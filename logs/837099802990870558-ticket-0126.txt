||2. Do you know a way how i can stop picking at scabs||
[2021-04-28 23:01:57] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: What I do sometimes to fall asleep I actually play YouTube videos of like super soften spoken people like an ASMR for sleep aid/help. Those exist too if you can’t find a live person to support you in VC to fall asleep with and I find them extremely therapeutic and relaxing. I either sleep with that or rain sounds every single night. 

As for the second one, I don’t know off hand if I’m my list of links I have anything for scan picking but I can definitely aid you in looking:)
