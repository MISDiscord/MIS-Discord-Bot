[2021-04-29 14:44:49] (834454534965297183) Legionnaire#8910: Oh well. Um, I have a problem.
[2021-04-29 14:47:03] (834454534965297183) Legionnaire#8910: During my time spending with a friend, I brought up a former hobby of mine that is ||pedo hunting|| and then suddenly, the urge to go back to that realm came to haunt me.
[2021-04-29 14:47:52] (834454534965297183) Legionnaire#8910: ....I felt emotionally exhausted during my time there. Felt like I don't belong there at all.
[2021-04-29 14:49:08] (834454534965297183) Legionnaire#8910: I really don't know what to do with this urge to go back to hobby that I have no interest or hesitant to go back to.
[2021-04-29 14:49:20] (834454534965297183) Legionnaire#8910: I want this to stop.
[2021-04-29 14:50:47] (834454534965297183) Legionnaire#8910: Is there a way?
[2021-04-29 14:51:16] (834454534965297183) Legionnaire#8910: Am I doomed to be this monster because of my past mistakes?
[2021-04-29 14:56:01] (834454534965297183) Legionnaire#8910: I'll just wait.

[2021-04-29 17:43:38] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: hi, i agreed to take over this ticket for amanda.
[2021-04-29 17:44:00] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: have you tried trying other coping mechanism or other hobbies?
[2021-04-30 04:01:08] (834454534965297183) Legionnaire#8910: Well... I do play the piano.
[2021-04-30 04:01:43] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: have you tried playing the piano whenever you get the urge to go back to the other hobby?
[2021-04-30 04:02:33] (834454534965297183) Legionnaire#8910: Yeah.
[2021-04-30 04:03:19] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: has that helped at all?
[2021-04-30 04:05:22] (834454534965297183) Legionnaire#8910: Not sure really.
[2021-04-30 04:06:21] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: can you try writing down your feelings afterwards and see how you feel?
[2021-04-30 04:32:15] (834454534965297183) Legionnaire#8910: I guess I'll try.
[2021-04-30 04:40:16] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: do you also think you try to remind yourself why you don't do that hobby anymore when you get those urges
[2021-04-30 04:41:03] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: when things get difficult you have to remind yourself why you quit them in the first place
[2021-04-30 04:44:45] (834454534965297183) Legionnaire#8910: That is true
[2021-04-30 04:46:08] (834454534965297183) Legionnaire#8910: Maybe I should try reminding myself that as to why I was forced retired from the hobby in the first place.
[2021-04-30 04:50:10] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yes if it was the best decision for you and your mental health then you should continue to stay away from it
[2021-04-30 05:09:36] (834454534965297183) Legionnaire#8910: Alright. Thanks.
[2021-04-30 05:18:14] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: I hope that it helps :)
