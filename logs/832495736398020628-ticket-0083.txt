[2021-04-16 10:41:33] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: thnks... but I think I can do this...
[2021-04-16 10:42:19] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: It's just hard to talk about it, it's like an inside fight for not doing it... u see me?
[2021-04-16 10:43:09] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i do see you, i bet that’s incredibly frustrating for you
[2021-04-16 10:44:06] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: kinda.. I want the words to go out, or to type tht, but, illogically I just don't do it... it's like a protection
[2021-04-16 10:45:02] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: now saying tht way, I can even say the reason for that... but tht's not the point
[2021-04-16 10:45:44] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: I did it again, I need to stop running from my problems
[2021-04-16 10:46:06] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: I will talk about it and I will talk it now...
[2021-04-16 10:46:50] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: (those were hard to get out but, ik tht I have to work tht)
[2021-04-16 10:47:41] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: you’re doing really well
[2021-04-16 10:48:03] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: thnks!!...
[2021-04-16 10:53:52] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: When I was 5yo, I was really sociable, and liked to meet everyone (I still kinda am tht way). But then I went to a school and attempted to do tht, and my entire class just started chasing me... they didn't said the reason or anything for what they were doing... I just remember of every day running from them (because they literally chased me chase me down every where) and having asma attacks every time... but I couldn't stop running, or they would hit me... every day tht I came back home I started to smash my head against the wall... guilty tht I couldn't do anything, just run, I couldn't hit anyone, it was like an imaginary force holding me back, because I was feeling tht pain....
[2021-04-16 10:54:33] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: so I think it is about this year I spent there
[2021-04-16 10:55:20] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: I had more than 5 years of therapy to hit someone tht was humiliating me again...
[2021-04-16 10:56:36] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: but I think is about tht.. it's not totally solved, it stills there
[2021-04-16 10:56:41] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: I still running
[2021-04-16 10:58:01] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: did the therapy not help with processing your feelings ?
[2021-04-16 10:58:26] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: it helped.. but I decided to quit
[2021-04-16 10:58:52] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: I didnt wanted to feel like a kid anymore, I wanted to abandon my past
[2021-04-16 11:00:59] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: Idk... I just, wanted to change, like, refuse tht this was part of me
[2021-04-16 11:01:14] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: therapy is a really big thing i can suggest, and sticking it until the end, but it’s important to find a treatment that works for you to help you understand the feelings you’re having and how to move past them and stop letting them control you
[2021-04-16 11:02:10] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: yes... now i have a new therapist, because I will travel this year to canada, and study one year there...
[2021-04-16 11:02:31] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: my parents were concerned about my mental health
[2021-04-16 11:02:36] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: so... yep
[2021-04-16 11:02:48] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: it’s nice that they were concerned for you
[2021-04-16 11:03:51] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: yes, they are... as long as Ik I dont have any mental issues...
[2021-04-16 11:04:24] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: I just... sorry, I just changed subject, me trying to run again...
[2021-04-16 11:05:21] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: it’s okay, you can talk about whatever you like, i’m just here to listen
[2021-04-16 11:06:22] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: they are concerned but they don't really know what's happening...
[2021-04-16 11:06:48] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: they already have enough stress with the work and my sister...
[2021-04-16 11:07:29] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: I keep telling them lies to calm them
[2021-04-16 11:08:23] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: being honest and open about mental health can be beneficial
[2021-04-16 11:08:58] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: but if I told them all tht is happening, I am very sure they would be very stressed about this
[2021-04-16 11:09:26] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: and, they stressed couldnt help my sister
[2021-04-16 11:09:50] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: who has bigger problems in life than me right now (I think...)
[2021-04-16 11:11:41] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: I'm already being loved and cared for them, my sister is not yet... and she is jealous of me ( I see tht as a fact) so she keep trying to receive more love
[2021-04-16 11:12:17] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: u see me?
[2021-04-16 11:13:31] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: this is so illogical, Im sorry if Im wasting your tie
[2021-04-16 11:15:57] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: I will just... this was a mistake
