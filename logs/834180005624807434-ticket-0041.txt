[2021-04-20 21:35:37] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: hey <@!769963453603250189> you arenâ€™t in trouble. we just want to check on you.
[2021-04-20 21:36:04] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: hey
[2021-04-20 21:36:56] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: weâ€™re gotten some reports that there are users that concerned about you.
[2021-04-20 21:37:16] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: im sorry
[2021-04-20 21:37:18] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i understand that i might be scary to ask for help but sometimes itâ€™s the best thing we can do.
[2021-04-20 21:37:28] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: donâ€™t apologize. youâ€™re all good.
[2021-04-20 21:37:39] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: im not doing so good rn
[2021-04-20 21:38:30] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i know. itâ€™s ok to not be ok. but we also need to ask for help when we need it.
[2021-04-20 21:39:30] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: do you think that you could call a crisis hotline and talk to them?
[2021-04-20 21:39:45] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: i dont think i want to
[2021-04-20 21:39:55] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: it would just make me more nervous
[2021-04-20 21:41:00] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i understand that. do you think that you could talk to one through chat?
[2021-04-20 21:41:10] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: then you donâ€™t have to call them.
[2021-04-20 21:41:34] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: i dont think we have that here
[2021-04-20 21:41:43] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: and i don't think they could help
[2021-04-20 21:41:56] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i can always look into it for you.
[2021-04-20 21:42:07] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: why do you think they can help?
[2021-04-20 21:42:15] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: idk
[2021-04-20 21:42:39] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: i just think it wouldn't help and if they can't help then there no hope
[2021-04-20 21:42:59] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: so I'd rather keep the hope that's left in me
[2021-04-20 21:43:06] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: even tho its small
[2021-04-20 21:43:49] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i understand believing it wonâ€™t help but sometimes itâ€™s good to just get all your feelings out even if someone doesnâ€™t say anything in return.
[2021-04-20 21:44:25] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: and maybe perhaps they say something that does help. you never know what the outcome will be.
[2021-04-20 21:44:39] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: im too tired to do anything anyways
[2021-04-20 21:44:47] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: I'm just sick of all this
[2021-04-20 21:45:31] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i understand but things wonâ€™t always be the way they are now.
[2021-04-20 21:46:37] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: youâ€™ve been doing so well. thereâ€™s no reason to give up that hope that things get better.
[2021-04-20 21:46:55] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: i dont believe they will
[2021-04-20 21:47:04] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: they do. i know they do.
[2021-04-20 21:47:09] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: but like i want to try
[2021-04-20 21:47:14] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: but i never try enough
[2021-04-20 21:48:12] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: donâ€™t blame yourself for not getting better as fast as you believe you should. things take time. you are trying and i can see that. just please donâ€™t think you arenâ€™t trying hard enough.
[2021-04-20 21:48:38] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: im sorry
[2021-04-20 21:48:43] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: im making people worry
[2021-04-20 21:49:07] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: you donâ€™t need to be sorry. people only worry because they care about you. we all want to see you happy.
[2021-04-20 21:50:04] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: i appreciate it

[2021-04-20 21:56:56] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: ok
[2021-04-20 21:57:30] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: do you mind letting me know what country you're in?
