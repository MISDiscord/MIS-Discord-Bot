[2021-04-17 00:20:35] (654503227051474977) ghostproductions#4913: Tw rape murder suicide depression abuse ||Okay so in 2016 i lived in a town called wile i didnt have many friends but the ones i did have were so amazing and i was a happy kid 24/7 at the time i knew i was attracted to guy and girls but kept it to myself thinking it didnt matter. Well at the end of the year my father tells me that we are moving to a even better neighborhood with kids my age and more friends. Now as a more grown up person i could see he was just saying this to make me not sad but back then i ate it up... well we moved to the new town and on day one 3 churches come to our door and my family goes in and by the first week my parents were christens apparently me and my sister never saw this as a big deal because we didnt know how far they would take it that school year i had no friends and was bullied and beat up twice... it was the first time I started having bad thoughts. At the time I could not understand the concept of suicide but I understand that i didnt wanna be here and wanted to run away. Then the next year i met Ben... he was my light he was to me what peanut butter is to jelly he made me so happy... until one night he spammed texted me asking for me to call and to help him only for me to think its no big deal because i was tired and go to sleep... he died that night by suicide... my world was lost... then the next month after my dad found gay porn on my phone i had to come out as bi... the next day he disowned me... and ever sense then has done nothing but influence the whole family to abuse and treat me like shit... i never had any irl friends because nobody wanted to talk to me... then i met grace... I thought she loved me... but she didnt.. .then one day she hit me in the back of the head and raped me... after that alot of girls would demand sex or demand images of me||

[2021-04-17 22:15:06] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Well what’s your usual way to cope right now
[2021-04-17 22:15:41] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Maybe there’s something we can work on and talk about together now that can maybe help you handle the stress and the feelings better
[2021-04-17 23:45:14] (654503227051474977) ghostproductions#4913: Rn its finding strangers and flirting and stuff.., because its the only way the voices stop... to sell myself
[2021-04-17 23:45:28] (654503227051474977) ghostproductions#4913: Before that it was cutting and banging my@head against the wall
[2021-04-17 23:45:51] (654503227051474977) ghostproductions#4913: But that only@happens now when i get really bad
[2021-04-18 00:32:24] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Well it’s always good to surround your self with people that like you, and being flirty can be a way to get your mind off things
[2021-04-18 00:32:38] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: It’s a way healthier option compared to the later
[2021-04-18 01:02:24] (654503227051474977) ghostproductions#4913: I guess but nobody is like me... most just leave me and block me after getting what they want
[2021-04-18 03:02:51] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: There are definitely some good people and bad people, it goes without saying of course too that there’s many ways to go about that type of stuff so if 1 way doesn’t work and they’re all bad maybe try a different approach to finding people to talk to maybe in nicer servers on discord or maybe a new dating app if your not satisfied with the results you’re getting now you know?:)
[2021-04-18 17:51:53] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Ok I’m gonna close this ticket if there isn’t anything else you wanna talk about is that ok?:)
[2021-04-18 20:20:55] (654503227051474977) ghostproductions#4913: Yeah im sorry i had work
[2021-04-18 20:21:04] (654503227051474977) ghostproductions#4913: Sorry to waste ur time not talking about much
[2021-04-18 20:38:20] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Not a waste, just open another ticket when you’re ready:)
