[2021-04-17 22:21:07] (790325167246671894) spacecowperson#9119: I so badly want to relapse and move my date up, i can’t deal with life anymore, i’m so tired of it
[2021-04-17 22:26:58] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: You mean your relapse with ||sh?||
[2021-04-17 22:28:26] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: If you’re in immediate need of help too I can always give you a list of the hotlines to call if you think you’re going to ||self-harm.|| I think there’s other alternatives that I can share if you’d like to hear about them too:/ 

Do you wanna also explain a little bit about what’s going on and why you’re feeling these feelings? I can try to better support you too if maybe there was a story or lead up to what’s going on
[2021-04-18 17:51:41] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Ok I’m gonna close this ticket if there isn’t anything else you wanna talk about is that ok?:)
