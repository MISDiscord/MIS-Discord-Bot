[2021-04-11 04:11:20] (796641918460231732) ElonMuskQuant#2362: ||Today, I learned after a screaming suicide attempt again from my mom that my dad never wanted to see me or associate him with me. My parents got divorced after an emotionally abusive marriage and my father forbids me to see my grandparents and only saw me when he was getting in trouble with his new wife. He signed custody away from me and never wanted to see me and only did after his parents screamed at him. I also learned when I needed surgery when I was 12 bc I may had a cyst which was cancerous and doctors were unsure and my father didn't want to see me and instead wanted sex with the wife since my half brother was away for camp. Overall, I also learned when I was accepted to a top uni my father refused to pay tuition bc it wasnt in a nice enough city where he can go and have fun. My father is over 53 years of age. I just feel like a mistake ||

[2021-04-15 01:57:09] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: bruh I got tinder and other apps because I'm lonely and want something irl, and as expected I did get asked to hook up and I'm like no I don't do hook ups, but the dude for some reason took "no I don't do hook ups" as "no I don't do just one hook up" and asked me to be a fwb? XD Like excuse me? XD I found it funny lkjafdsjlk the audacity XD

[2021-04-15 18:19:57] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: and my other friend met his new girlfriend through tinder

[2021-04-18 00:26:33] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: and the 1 doesn't want a relationship (which I'm okay with of course, I want friends) but we were supposed to meet today and he couldn't make it ;3;
[2021-04-18 00:26:48] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: more than slightly disappointed
[2021-04-19 02:59:56] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: Dating apps weren't a thing before my marriage and divorce... So trying to figure that shit out now is like I woke up on a different planet. I got one date off FB dating and she stole my Nintendo switch and failed to inform me of her bf in jail at the time I met her.
[2021-04-19 03:01:41] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: That’s really shitty, Ridiculum. We don’t have a Facebook, or any social media other than dating apps, tbh.
[2021-04-19 03:02:18] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: It took us forever to save up for a Switch for our kids. If someone stole that we’d lose our shit.
[2021-04-19 03:25:36] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I lent it to her son, and she later accosted me when I requested to have it back as though I was talking it from her poor little boy, how terrible I was. But I had let her know clearly before hand i was lending it to him temporarily
[2021-04-19 03:27:00] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: <@443130730478960670> We stopped seeing each other due to boundary issues she had and not respecting mine, and I asked to get the switch back and she laid the guilty on thick
[2021-04-19 03:27:35] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I've tried maybe 4 apps, all a nightmare
[2021-04-19 03:27:57] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: Dating apps
[2021-04-19 03:28:54] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: Being a 30 somethin and divorced is a brutal landscape, even just looking for friends
[2021-04-19 03:29:00] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Ah that sucks. It is hard to find someone who’s conceptualization of boundaries matches our own. We love dating apps a lot though. We like to flirt, and they boost our ego. It is hard to find good dates though, we are super picky. Might only go on a date with 1 in 50 or so people we actually talk to for a couple weeks.
[2021-04-19 03:29:21] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: People were much more open in their 20s.... and we meet at actual IRL places 🤣
[2021-04-19 03:29:52] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Yeah well, we always meet in public. Lots of dangerous people out there.
[2021-04-19 03:29:57] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: <@443130730478960670> when you say we you mean?
[2021-04-19 03:30:13] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We use first person plural pronouns.
[2021-04-19 03:30:30] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: Got ya
[2021-04-19 03:31:32] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: It’s harder out there now for sure. Everyone is too scared to go out except for a few people, generally they types that we don’t jive with. We’ve gotten a few dates though.
[2021-04-19 03:36:55] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: that's good
[2021-04-19 03:37:37] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I get a lot of matches because my profile seems genuine to most individuals, but I've noticed people are flaky and don't engage in depth conversation
[2021-04-19 03:38:20] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: they're waiting for the male to make that move and I'm the kind of person who have to establish a repoire (sic) and trust before I ask anyone to meet me
[2021-04-19 03:38:36] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Yeah, we usually plan a real date in the first 2 weeks. If something doesn’t happen by then we move on. No point in wasting time.
[2021-04-19 03:38:55] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I like a fair amount of banter and getting to know a person, trust is a big thing for me when it comes to taking that step out there.
[2021-04-19 03:39:07] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: 2 weeks is reasonable
[2021-04-19 03:39:34] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We don’t think people are able to be truly honest online. Can’t feel who they are until you meet them.
[2021-04-19 03:39:56] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I can't get conversations to last long past 2-3 days. Granted, I'm flaky too. Since I wasn't into the dating app thing and married for a bit, it's been an adjustment. I have trouble keeping the dating apps in my regular phone app rotation
[2021-04-19 03:40:40] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: How long were you married for? Our first marriage was 5 years. We’re engaged to be married again soon.
[2021-04-19 03:43:22] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: Yeah, those profiles are advertisements for whether your "dating material", not really profiles for your genuine character as a human being. I don't identify with career and work, my profiles just don't read like a dating thing. But I'd rather weed out the ones I know are a waste of time first, so I put myself straight up on there. Which, again, it does get matches, but it doesn't translate to dates. I think people can tell I'm still figuring things out in my life, and naturally, a lot of women want a "man" whose got his shit together. If only people knew, having one's shit together is a total myth
[2021-04-19 03:43:46] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I dated her for 7 years, we lived together for a lot of that and were married 2-3 years
[2021-04-19 03:44:13] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: 2011-2018
[2021-04-19 03:44:29] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Yeah, stability is a huge thing once people hit their 30s.
[2021-04-19 03:44:31] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: You're engaged, congrats!
[2021-04-19 03:44:33] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: how'd you meet?
[2021-04-19 03:44:46] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We met on a dating site, lol.
[2021-04-19 03:45:42] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: No one has their shit together, you’re right. The most imprint thing is projecting the possibility that your shit will be together in the future, and isn’t out of control now.
[2021-04-19 03:46:28] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We’re, like, super fucked up in a lot of ways, but we still attract people because they don’t have to carry our baggage. We’ve got a handle on our shit, including the two kids.
[2021-04-19 03:46:52] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: stability is something I wish I had more of, but it's not something I'm willing to force. I have a home business now which in itself I'm impressed I made it work and had the guts to do it. But your own business doesn't break even or make money right off the bat. You learn as you go. And I'm okay with my life being a learning experience. I don't expect I'll be a home owner or have kids for a while, I still got plenty to work out for myself. Learn & grow
[2021-04-19 03:48:02] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: That’s pretty cool. We haven’t ever been able to hold a real job. Our partner is going to med school though, in a year and a half.
[2021-04-19 03:48:25] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: Yeah, I'm "fucked up" in my own ways, but sometimes that's what has built character. And people with "problems" often times have very intriguing personalities, they're less judgmental, and they have a good sense of humor. I don't know that I'd be compatible with a "normal" person.
[2021-04-19 03:49:27] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: Well, then you get to hold down the fort and just be that rock and support. There's plenty you can do to be crucial in that dynamic. Jobs and careers can be HIGHLY overrated in terms of demonstrating a persons worthiness and capacity as a partner
[2021-04-19 03:50:50] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Yeah, it is only one half of a healthy life. We still brought in money, but it was eating at us. Now our partner has a student loan. We haven’t worked since November. Probably won’t ever work again now.
[2021-04-19 03:52:50] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We do well at keeping our partner sane and on track, for the most part. We think we bring a lot of value to a relationship, even if some people think our skills don’t matter,
[2021-04-19 03:55:41] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I won't ever be employed again I think
[2021-04-19 03:55:48] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: so I gotta make the home biz work, I'm determined
[2021-04-19 03:56:03] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: jobs in the real marketplace were too triggering for my substance issues
[2021-04-19 03:56:50] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Yeah that can be a real issue. We used to be an addict. Now just an alcoholic.
[2021-04-19 03:56:54] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: And my learning and work style don't fit the molds of traditional, corporate, or latter climbing workplaces. Work has to have elements of play and curiosity for me to remain engaged with it
[2021-04-19 03:57:28] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I'm not driven by competitiveness or impressing the higher-ups. I'm only driven by what I find interesting or fun.
[2021-04-19 03:57:58] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I've been struggling with the Alcohol during pandemic

[2021-04-19 04:01:39] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I was surprised I couldn't find sober support groups on discord
[2021-04-19 04:03:04] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: <@!443130730478960670> are you trying to moderate ||alcohol|| or do you have it pretty well balanced?
[2021-04-19 04:05:04] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We were bad last year, but we got it mostly under control again. Had some bad news last month and we thought that we had to stop drinking for a little bit or we would ||kill ourself.||
[2021-04-19 04:05:23] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I've been trying to curb the use, my depression has been brutal during ||COVID|| and keeps sneaking back up since the divorce. My father passed at the same time as all that too. So it's just been a rough 2-3 years. This new clinic I'm at is trying ||ketamine|| treatments with me. So that's new. If the depresh isn't in check, I just gotta try and stay off the sauce. Easier said than done
[2021-04-19 04:06:00] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: Drinking would ||kill you|| or it was leading to ||suicidal thoughts||
[2021-04-19 04:06:33] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We stopped all our psychiatric medications. We no longer have faith in them for our issues, it’s been 15 years and we’re not any better.
[2021-04-19 04:06:52] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I've got a REAL treatment resistant type of mood disorder
[2021-04-19 04:11:19] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I stopped taking my meds as well, but recently am back on one...better than 4-5 they had me on before. I honestly can't say I see the difference with the exception of ||adderall|| for my ADHD. So that's  2 meds I guess. The ADHD med being the ONE that has been effective for me. I support people who want to try being off meds, if they're safe about it. I managed for over a year that way and couldn't tell one way from the other. And being off the meds I was able to try ||microdosing psychedelics||, I suppose I shouldn't recommend that or anything. But ||LSD|| does help me. There's simply the issue of finding it and it not being shady.
[2021-04-19 04:12:17] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I hope they fast track studies with ||psychedelics|| so people can be treated clinically and safely if they prove to have therapeutic benefit
[2021-04-19 04:12:42] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: That is unfortunate. Our psychiatrist isn’t sure what is wrong with us yet. We have been seeing her for a year and, while the list has narrowed a bit, there is still no clear treatment plan.
[2021-04-19 04:13:39] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: What symptoms typically? If you don't mind me asking...promise I won't diagnose. Just wondering what you struggle with
[2021-04-19 04:15:20] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We’re not psychotic, but we have temporary psychotic states. We’re not borderline but we have some features of it. We not schizophrenic, but we are some form of schizotypal. Lots of dissociative symptoms, but we have lots of confounding symptoms. We get a bit of everything.
[2021-04-19 04:19:51] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: Damn, I see. I spent some time in Behavioral Health facilities, compared to rehab, I found more kinship with people who had severe mental health diagnoses. They were all around more self-aware, usually very bright, down to earth, and had good senses of humor. Sorry to hear about all that ails you, but you seem to have a handle on the reality of it. That shit is real, and I don't wish it upon anyone. You're very level-headed in my estimation though, and I appreciate you being willing to discuss this stuff
[2021-04-19 04:20:54] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Thank you. We are better at dealing with things now, for sure. We decided to teach ourself psychology since our doctors have never been able to help us.
[2021-04-19 04:22:34] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: a lot of people steer clear, or otherwise can't understand it. most people who know me can't get that what I struggle with is debilitating. They just see a smart, white, male, who has held down jobs before and went to college and wonder why I haven't figured it all out by now. Believe me, there are times I wish I was dull and my needs were simple. A lot of people assume these things are something you can just "get over" and "grind it out"
[2021-04-19 04:23:28] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: Oh yeah, studying psychology is definitely wise. That's what I tried to get a degree in. I've read a lot about it. It does get strange though when yous start knowing more than some of the NP's or clinicians or counselors you've had. strange and frustrating
[2021-04-19 04:25:00] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Yes, it is a poorly understood subject by many, even in the medical field. We don’t typically tell anyone about our issues unless it’s online. We go to a lot of effort to appear normal most of the time, don’t usually succeed, but better than if we just acted like our normal crazy self.
[2021-04-19 04:26:04] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I have an outlet for my manic chaotic tendencies... music
[2021-04-19 04:26:24] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: It’s rap but very experimental
[2021-04-19 04:27:06] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I let all the anarchic impulses channel through that. It’s not been working so much lately though
[2021-04-19 04:27:46] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: That’s pretty cool. Our partner makes music to deal with her emotions. Black metal of various sorts. She plays guitar, bass, piano, and the accordion.
[2021-04-19 04:27:55] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I was on a roll and even published music on streaming platforms like Spotify...but hit a wall recently
[2021-04-19 04:28:04] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I love metal
[2021-04-19 04:35:08] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: Progressive metal and post-rock stuff mostly. At some point I think I just want to make music and learn production cause I’m not sure establishing myself as a rapper and finding my niche will ever happen.

Does your partner make instrumental stuff on garage band or any programs? I rap to instrumentals most people wouldn’t think to. I write to heavy guitar riffs all the time. Then transfer over to a more traditional hip hop sound and record the lyrics to that.
[2021-04-19 04:36:05] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: anyway, I have WIDE tastes in music. Is your partners music online anywhere?
[2021-04-19 04:36:12] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: She uses those programs to share her music with her band, but she writes all the string and piano stuff after playing it.
[2021-04-19 04:36:32] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: She has some stuff online, but she took it down recently as they’re rebranding.
[2021-04-19 04:36:32] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I see, damn, I'm jealous I need to learn an instrument
[2021-04-19 04:38:27] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Yeah, we used to play drums and the piano but it has been too many years.
[2021-04-19 04:38:37] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: It can be a lot of fun.
[2021-04-19 04:39:10] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: Yeah, that's what I wonder, if I'll have to rebrand and make some atmospheric/electronica stuff. Give up on the rap ambitions, and just make ear candy. Drums are the shit! My brother is a brilliant percussionist. We were gonna start a rock/rap fusion band but we've not been able to practice often enough and we need to get in a studio
[2021-04-19 04:39:40] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: Do you listen to any rap?
[2021-04-19 04:39:52] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Our favourite post-rock band is Wang Wen. Their album *Invisible City* is a real journey.
[2021-04-19 04:40:06] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I'll have to check into that, lemme look it up
[2021-04-19 04:40:31] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: From time to time, not so much though. Prefer punk. We listen to Cyprus Hill, Kottonmouth Kings, and some other classic rappers though.
[2021-04-19 04:42:14] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I'm all about Russian Circles, Red Sparrowes, Barrows...and then with vocals Cult of Luna, Tool, Mastodon (their earlier stuff), Windhand, Dillinger Escape Plan
[2021-04-19 04:42:58] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: Cypress Hill, hah, funny you should mention that, a song we actually mixed and mastered as a band has a Cypress Hill sound to it. The rock/rap type of Cypress
[2021-04-19 04:43:00] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Mastodon has a lot of good music for sure. Our first song we ever heard from them was Sleeping Giants and we were instantly hooked.
[2021-04-19 04:43:02] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I love Cypress Hill
[2021-04-19 04:43:18] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: Sleeping Giants!! goddamn, that song converted me to those guys
[2021-04-19 04:43:54] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I was living in Alaska and driving super late at night in the winter alone, NOBODY on the roads, and that song was blasting and I basically had my mind obliterated. I had never heard anything like it
[2021-04-19 04:44:34] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Where abouts in Alaska were you?
[2021-04-19 04:44:42] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I didn't know who they were and just downloaded them on a whim because they'd gotten such good reviews. That whole album is next level
[2021-04-19 04:44:52] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: Eagle River, outside of Anchorage
[2021-04-19 04:44:58] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: between Anchorage and Wasilla
[2021-04-19 04:44:59] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Yeah it definitely was.
[2021-04-19 04:45:35] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: got Wang Wen on 😉
[2021-04-19 04:45:36] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Oh damn, we were out there for a few months. Landed in Anchorage and then moved around for a few months before leaving,
[2021-04-19 04:45:50] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: Winter time?
[2021-04-19 04:46:32] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: You gotta hear Barrows, their song Wrath of the Sea
[2021-04-19 04:47:23] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Spring/summer. We remember stepping outside onto our balcony and just across the driveway was this huge moose. It was the first time we’d ever been surrounded by snow and also feeling warm in just a T-shirt.
[2021-04-19 04:47:37] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Not the closest we’ve been to a live moose though.
[2021-04-19 04:48:28] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: this Wang Wen is definitely right up my ally. Post-rock bliss, I just love the genre. Great music on ||LSD||
[2021-04-19 04:48:41] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We’ll have to give them a listen in the morning.
[2021-04-19 04:49:27] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We cannot consume || hallucinogenics||. We hallucinate without them.
[2021-04-19 04:49:28] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: Wang Wen uses a lot of slight electronic touches here and there that make them pretty damn unique. How many band members are they?
[2021-04-19 04:49:52] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: Yeah, I know, I was gonna say you can't take ||psychedelics||
[2021-04-19 04:50:03] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Not a clue. We stopped researching band backgrounds after we found out The Hu are nazis.
[2021-04-19 04:50:28] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: it would exacerbate symptoms, no question
[2021-04-19 04:50:40] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Yes, it get bad.
[2021-04-19 04:50:40] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: The Hu?
[2021-04-19 04:50:53] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Mongolian band.
[2021-04-19 04:50:53] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: that would be a bummer to find out a band you like is Nazis
[2021-04-19 04:51:05] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Started off really strong, but then went mainstream.
[2021-04-19 04:51:33] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Also tried to hide their supremacist roots by editing it out of their YouTube videos.
[2021-04-19 04:53:08] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: I dunno if you've heard of James Blake, but you probably have Kid Cudi...that experimental type sound is what I'd mess around with but I'd have it without lyrics. Or lyrics sparingly. And then I'd have the songs progress like post-rock metal. Another group is Massive Attack that I totally would take inspiration from. Dystopian sci-fi sounds, if that makes sense
[2021-04-19 04:53:16] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: Yeah, you go mainstream, people are gonna know your shit
[2021-04-19 04:53:31] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Massive Attack is awesome.
[2021-04-19 04:55:03] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: that's why I wanted to stay mostly anonymous if I could help it. my rap under Vanbiguous is on spotify, The Empire Game EP ...and then I experiment and freestyle stuff that I throw on Instagram. But when I really learn music composition and mixing/mastering I will probably use a new moniker and try to stay under the radar. At least make efforts to not let people know who I am personally. I like my privacy
[2021-04-19 04:55:59] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Think we’ve heard of both Blake and Cudi, but it is hard to say. We have a very broad taste in music. Our partner is the same with her privacy. She a Saudi refugee. She does shows dressed as a man, lol.

[2021-04-19 04:57:47] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: that track is the Cypress Hill type my brother and I made
[2021-04-19 04:57:56] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: wait, lemme DM that to you instead
[2021-04-19 04:58:50] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Alright, we’ll give it a listen in the morning.
