[2021-04-12 20:12:42] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: my mother hugged me and it messed me up badly
[2021-04-12 20:12:52] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: caused me to lose progress
[2021-04-12 20:14:36] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: i dont want to lose more and she hasn't hugged me in a long time i think it could mean something bad
[2021-04-12 20:15:12] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: im just thinking about it and cant seem to figure out what cause her behavior
[2021-04-12 20:15:57] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: it wasn't even a hug that showed affection
[2021-04-12 20:16:38] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: hey ifi, can i suggest maybe taking taking a step back for a second? finding somewhere quiet to take a second to relax?
[2021-04-12 20:17:16] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: take some deep breaths? *mostly just for the movement of it*
[2021-04-12 20:17:41] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: ill be fine
[2021-04-12 20:18:25] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: i just don't get why i feel so unsafe around her she is supposed to be mother right even tho she doesn't care about me
[2021-04-12 20:18:43] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: she hates me lol why would she hug me
[2021-04-12 20:18:48] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: why now
[2021-04-12 20:19:04] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: i cant seem to think of anything other than something negative
[2021-04-12 20:20:52] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: yeah that’s completely valid, but instead of dwelling on it i suggest trying to clear your mind from it
[2021-04-12 20:22:06] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: if possible of course, overthinking it won’t change anything, however, if think you are in danger if there is someway to leave or go somewhere else or make sure someone near you knows what’s happening i suggest you do that
[2021-04-12 20:23:23] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: i just lost all the progress i made
[2021-04-12 20:23:31] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: i hate myself for it
[2021-04-12 20:24:15] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: why did she have to do that now it was good when she was just yelling at me or ignoring me
[2021-04-12 20:24:28] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: i was used to it ya know
[2021-04-12 20:26:33] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: mhms, i’m sorry, little step, one step backward isn’t losing everything, you know what you know now and can hopefully use it again to help get back to where you where
[2021-04-12 20:28:38] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: idk if its worth it lol
