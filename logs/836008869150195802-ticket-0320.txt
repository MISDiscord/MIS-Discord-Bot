[2021-04-26 00:24:55] (695393735466418269) Lemon/ليمون🍋#3190: So is that a mental illness?
[2021-04-26 00:24:58] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: are you diagnosed? no? so you’re showing signs of the diagnosis but you don’t have it

[2021-04-26 00:27:01] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: but the test tells you that you have it
[2021-04-26 00:27:03] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: it might be a cold
[2021-04-26 00:27:06] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: you don’t know
[2021-04-26 00:27:13] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: only a doctor does
[2021-04-26 00:27:26] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: that’s why you go get a test
[2021-04-26 00:27:33] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: to see if you have it
[2021-04-26 00:29:53] (695393735466418269) Lemon/ليمون🍋#3190: You know 1 months ago I showed every symptom of depression I evan had suicidal thoughts,and I attempted suicide more than 5 times
[2021-04-26 00:30:46] (695393735466418269) Lemon/ليمون🍋#3190: So I dont know if thats enough information to be diagnosed
[2021-04-26 00:30:56] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: then i’m sure you would’ve gotten a diagnosis by your doctor

[2021-04-26 00:31:34] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: this conversation is unproductive, it’s going in circles, unless a doctor tells you that you have a mental illness, then you cannot claim to have it.
