[2021-04-14 18:42:20] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: im’ just useless
[2021-04-14 19:02:58] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: ok imma try this again and not delete it this time because I’m a dumbass who can’t express themselves without panicking and deleting it

I’m just so exhausted I’m fucking useless and I just want to die I don’t wanna to fucking function like this it’s so tiring I never feel like I’m good enough I never feel like I’m enough for people I’m just a fucking fuck up and in all honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if people are happy I died because I do be a piece of shit.

I can’t do *anything* right I can’t keep friends, make friends I can’t do shit I’m just a toxic piece of shit who deserves nothing I deserve to be alone.

Maybe I should just isolate myself because people would be better without me right and my brain can’t stop fucking thinking up suicide things in vivid detail or even fucking just getting hurt accidentally.

But part of me is like “oh well who fucking cares your just an attention seeker anyway” and it’s just fucking exhausting because I can’t even validate myself who else can I expect to? Everything’s just fucking made up and I’m a fake piece of shit who no one would miss if they died.

(Please don’t ping support)
