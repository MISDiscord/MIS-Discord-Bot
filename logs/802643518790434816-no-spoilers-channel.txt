I’m just so exhausted I’m fucking useless and I just want to die I don’t wanna to fucking function like this it’s so tiring I never feel like I’m good enough I never feel like I’m enough for people I’m just a fucking fuck up and in all honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if people are happy I died because I do be a piece of shit.

I can’t do *anything* right I can’t keep friends, make friends I can’t do shit I’m just a toxic piece of shit who deserves nothing I deserve to be alone.

Maybe I should just isolate myself because people would be better without me right and my brain can’t stop fucking thinking up suicide things in vivid detail or even fucking just getting hurt accidentally.

But part of me is like “oh well who fucking cares your just an attention seeker anyway” and it’s just fucking exhausting because I can’t even validate myself who else can I expect to? Everything’s just fucking made up and I’m a fake piece of shit who no one would miss if they died.

[2021-04-14 23:45:07] (820071609683148801) Lilac_cat#5631: Sometimes I have thoughts where I wanna hurt myself or do something bad like throw myself infront of a car it’s hard sometimes not to do it is that normal?
[2021-04-14 23:45:56] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: That would be an intrusive thought. It is somewhat normal, yes, though if you experience it frequently and it is distressing you then it is something you could consider seeking help for.
[2021-04-14 23:48:00] (820071609683148801) Lilac_cat#5631: It happens somewhat frequently and sometimes I don’t want to hurt myself but do other things like for example punch someone or hit them or break something and those are hard not to do and sometimes I just have to do it.
[2021-04-14 23:49:13] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: That does seem quite problematic for maintaining a healthy relationship with people. Have you been able to speak to a therapist or counselor about these thoughts/actions?
[2021-04-14 23:52:13] (820071609683148801) Lilac_cat#5631: No because my parents don’t think I need therapy and that my anxiety etc. Can be fixed by doing other things. And because of Covid I haven’t been with many other people but family. This means that sometimes when I have these thoughts it’s at home. I feel like especially it happens and it’s hard not to say mean things too. Sometimes mostly to my brother :( and it just comes out I can’t really stop it or I’ll hit him and I feel so bad :(
[2021-04-14 23:55:23] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: That sounds difficult. Our parents never believed that we needed therapy either. It took us a long time to get it without their help. Do you think there's something you could do to convince your parents that you need this?
[2021-04-14 23:56:34] (820071609683148801) Lilac_cat#5631: I’ve asked for therapy before but they just said I needed to exercise more, eat better, drink more water etc. And it’s so.....
[2021-04-14 23:57:34] (820071609683148801) Lilac_cat#5631: I try my best not to do what the thoughts say but idk like I said it happens with my brother a lot and I try so hard to be nice but the thoughts tell me not to
[2021-04-15 00:00:30] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: It is normal to be impulsive at your age, when your brain is not finished fully developing. They probably think it has something to do with that more than a behaviour which needs attention. Sometimes it can help to do a bit of research into why you might be behaving that way so you can present to them a more clear picture of the issue. Parents can be really pig-headed about these sorts of things because it is hard to accept that their child needs a form of help which they cannot provide.
[2021-04-15 00:02:10] (820071609683148801) Lilac_cat#5631: Yeah I’m also scared to ask it was so hard the first time to ask and stuff also I don’t wanna disappoint them but thank you for your help:)
[2021-04-15 00:03:03] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: You're welcome. Good luck bringing it up with them in the future. That is really the best way to get them to see the issue.

[2021-04-16 01:38:13] (361090270659608577) noodle_#9431: I know it shouldn't be bothering me this much, but I just had a panic attack over going back to school in person almost full-time next year... I haven't spent more than 3 hours a day on campus for more than 3 days a week all school year, and I got an email before dinner from my academic advisor... it said that all the high school students taking classes through the nearby community college (which is everyone in 11th and 12th grade, aka me) will be going onto the college campus from 8:30 am - 3 pm 5 days a week the entire school year. I'm more overwhelmed then I've ever been as it is... and I'm barely going on campus. 

keep in mind, i'm going to stay with my grandparents this summer. I was supposed to stay from May 13th - October. this was only possible because we thought i wouldn't have to be in person until January... now that i have to be in person, my only break from my parents in 4 years is being shortened by over a month. not only does it mean that i have less time to recover mentally, it means i have one month less of a break from my abusive father. oh and not only that... but i'll be taking 3 college classes and a high school course for the first 16 weeks of the school year. that's more classes than I've taken since the beginning of this year. that's the number of classes that broke me and made me even more of a fucking failure than i already was. that's the number of classes that hurt me so bad mentally that i'm still recovering 7 months later. i dont know what to do... my best friend just kinda brushed me off when i said something about this because she's been doing zoom classes 8 hours a day since last august.. and i have nobody to talk to.. and im really fucking overwhelmed.
[2021-04-16 11:12:41] (428653342999183370) keykey#0420: so i had a drs appointment today, and they had to do the depression checklist thing bc yk. my profile says i have depression so. and i realized how uhh sewerslidal ive been lately <:SCstand:664509407421530114> im wondering if i should go to a ward or just wait till my mood medication is at full dose again (love having to titrate up for 2 weeks if you miss >3 days 😐) also fun fact idk why when i attempted at 14 they didnt take me to a ward like hello. huh. but anyways. idk how like

Is being suicidal not enough? Do they want me to go? Of course I don't need to actively attempt but the thought of not wanting to be here is frequent. More so then not. Or must it be till the very end when the rope is tied? is then that I'll be taken seriously?

I’m sure there are plenty of people who take you seriously including your parents. Maybe you should just talk to them about how you’re feeling or maybe a friend or school counsellor.

I can barely even get up in the damn morning, i can barely even eat without feeling disgusted with myself, like, what's the point in me being alive anymore, I can't even be happy, i can barely even hold in my feelings anymore.... i just want to ||die||


i barely even know what/who is me anymore, is it someone that cries 24/7, or someone who smokes there pain away so much that they're now numb and can barely even make it through that fucking day....Maybe I'm the second one, it definitely feels like it. And yeah, i know it's unhealthy but it helps me even though it's technically illegal- but whatever....

maybe if i became more numb i could get the guts to jump lol, like wouldn't that be amazing, i want to do it soon though so no one misses me.... But sometimes i have a good day but mostly it's not even me. like all i am is a depressed, emo, toxic bitch right? life is too confusing and painful for this shit lol, maybe it would be best if i died

[2021-04-22 13:28:13] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Our gender psychiatrist said she is going to refuse to allow us to go for surgery unless we go on medications, even though she admitted that the medications we've been on in the past have been ineffective or detrimental. 'Just keep trying until you find one' she says. As if we haven't tried that for 15 years.

[2021-04-22 18:17:05] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We were approved last year after a suicide attempt and during the throes of some significant psychotic events. Both her and her colleague said 'Well, it looks like this might be the best opportunity for you.' Then the pandemic hit and everything got fucked. So this year we had to get approved again and now she's saying that we're not stable enough. Like, we're doing better now than ever before and we're somehow not stable enough compared to this time last year? 

We asked her to give us a specific list of goals to achieve before she would send us for surgery and she just made a treatment plan with no goals other than 'be on the treatments I am prescribing.'
