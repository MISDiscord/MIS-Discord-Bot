[2021-04-09 07:00:25] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: SMH
[2021-04-09 07:00:32] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: yup!
[2021-04-09 07:00:45] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: and Patrick and Fabrice our two members of our system and they are also dating
[2021-04-09 07:01:02] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: and I think Ethan has a crush on Robin, issue is Ethan is stuck at his age of 14 and Robin will age...I think so it's...rough ;3;
[2021-04-09 07:01:13] (724929820726919180) Yuki_blue <3#2872: Hachi yeah
[2021-04-09 07:01:20] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: currently I'm the only one who actually dates outside of our system
[2021-04-09 07:01:36] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: but I haven't for a while, nor do I know if I should? especially if I want to be not host
[2021-04-09 07:02:15] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: I talk about myself a lot

[2021-04-09 07:02:34] (724929820726919180) Yuki_blue <3#2872: Hachi to be honest it is a rough decision if whether I should date outside of our system..
[2021-04-09 07:03:11] (724929820726919180) Yuki_blue <3#2872: Hachi honestly I don't know if I'm fine or not..
[2021-04-09 07:04:11] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: I probably just plain shouldn't take a relationship anyways because everytime I do I tell them "hey I have *lists disorders and issues and things I do and problems I have*" them: "yeah that's cool" them in a few days-weeks: "Yeah no this isn't working" us: *no longer an us*
[2021-04-09 07:04:50] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: knowing whether or not you're ready mentally for a relationship is a big step. another one is finding someone who's totally okay with what you have going on
[2021-04-09 07:04:56] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: hard to find smh

[2021-04-09 07:05:39] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: well if we both bonded and were dealing with our issues in a positive manner and liked each other, it's a great thing to have going on XD

[2021-04-09 07:06:07] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: both have to work on themselves in a positive manner though, and be aware. it's tricky
