[2021-04-09 07:00:25] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: SMH
[2021-04-09 07:00:32] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: yup!
[2021-04-09 07:00:45] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: and Patrick and Fabrice our two members of our system and they are also dating
[2021-04-09 07:01:02] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: and I think Ethan has a crush on Robin, issue is Ethan is stuck at his age of 14 and Robin will age...I think so it's...rough ;3;
[2021-04-09 07:01:13] (724929820726919180) Yuki_blue <3#2872: Hachi yeah
[2021-04-09 07:01:20] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: currently I'm the only one who actually dates outside of our system
[2021-04-09 07:01:36] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: but I haven't for a while, nor do I know if I should? especially if I want to be not host
[2021-04-09 07:02:15] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: I talk about myself a lot

[2021-04-09 07:02:34] (724929820726919180) Yuki_blue <3#2872: Hachi to be honest it is a rough decision if whether I should date outside of our system..
[2021-04-09 07:03:11] (724929820726919180) Yuki_blue <3#2872: Hachi honestly I don't know if I'm fine or not..
[2021-04-09 07:04:11] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: I probably just plain shouldn't take a relationship anyways because everytime I do I tell them "hey I have *lists disorders and issues and things I do and problems I have*" them: "yeah that's cool" them in a few days-weeks: "Yeah no this isn't working" us: *no longer an us*
[2021-04-09 07:04:50] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: knowing whether or not you're ready mentally for a relationship is a big step. another one is finding someone who's totally okay with what you have going on
[2021-04-09 07:04:56] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: hard to find smh

[2021-04-09 07:05:39] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: well if we both bonded and were dealing with our issues in a positive manner and liked each other, it's a great thing to have going on XD

[2021-04-09 07:06:07] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: both have to work on themselves in a positive manner though, and be aware. it's tricky

[2021-04-11 01:32:53] (540371757769424921) Betsy#9202: Just came across a person in one of my groups who owns and in-home day care and is looking for someone to come in and help her for six hours a day five days a week for the princely wage of $0
[2021-04-11 01:33:33] (540371757769424921) Betsy#9202: Takes me back to when I was dumb and young and didn't realize the value of my labor

[2021-04-11 01:37:46] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: damn i would kinda understand if you could use it for volunteer hours but you need to be ||cpr and first aid|| certified to help with children so i feel like there should at least be some compensation since you had to do training for it
[2021-04-11 01:40:28] (540371757769424921) Betsy#9202: The thing is, this is a for-profit daycare as far as I can tell. This lady is looking to make money off of someone else's labor

TW ||derealization ? Depression kinda and bullying and self hate||
I stared at the person in the mirror.
They stared back.
I tilted my head slightly to the left
They did the same, as if they were mocking me.
I stared at their face
The moles that formed a triangle if you'd connect the dots.
The bags under their eyes that grew everyday.
The cracked lips in the need of chapstick.
The eyebrows that were slightly unsymmetrical.
The jawline that wasn't really there.
The hair that was still growing but always messy.
The blue eyes that never seemed to light up.
I laughed at them
For looking so plain.
For looking so tired.
For looking so ugly.
For looking so stupid.
For looking so weird.
Who even are they?
I kept staring at the person across me as they started to cry.
I kept staring as their eyes got swollen and tears started to roll down their face.
I kept staring even though I knew it was wrong.
They begged me to stop staring.
But I didn't.
"Useless"
"Idiot"
"Good-for-nothing"
"Weirdo"
"Ugly"
"Ugly"
"Ugly"
With every word that I spoke
The mirror shattered a bit.
More and more
Until the pieces all broke down onto the floor.
I walked away in piece, knowing
That I'd never have to look at my reflection again.

[2021-04-19 02:25:07] (340385683409600512) c‚Äôest_la_vie.#1813: ||so what i always do is I remind myself "well. I've done what I can. I did what I did and I can't change that now. But what i can do now is remember that in order to get better sometimes we have to have set backs." It's like... math. You mess up? Well you can go back and try again. You can keep trying to get it right. And no matter what sometimes you don't get the right answer. However don't give up. because there **is** an answer. sh isnt the answer. but it happens sometimes. its part of your recovery process. now from here we just have to try again! Even I did that.|| (this is part one for ||if you relapsed.||
[2021-04-19 02:25:15] (340385683409600512) c‚Äôest_la_vie.#1813: lemme write some more
[2021-04-19 02:30:28] (340385683409600512) c‚Äôest_la_vie.#1813: ||Your past is your past. you did what you did. and you SUFFERED! you made it here tho. Youve come so far! Your past sh urges are actually quite common. every one has some sort of coping mechanism and thats just how it is. some are healthy! others not so much! what matters now is that **You are doing your best to be strong even when you have these memories or bad moments!** I think one of the biggest parts of MY recovery was realizing that I was suffering and needed to get better. The only way I knew that was because of sh. I want you to know that the scars and mistakes that you made, can be made into something beautiful. 
when you feel guilty about these things
-take a breath.
-remember that you survived and are going to be okay even if you struggle(d). 
-be proud rn for reaching out to talk
- and of course remember that you're getting better. Sometimes its baby steps that are nearly impossible to see.||

But I normally struggle with getting interested in wanting to do anything at all so when something gets me motivated I kind of burn the candle at both ends

When you have a passion or something that fascinates you you can continue to pursue it, regardless of what is happening in the world. Most of us are of little to no significant influence, but we can still impact the lives of the people we care about.

[2021-04-23 18:18:25] (722510980785111092) Trish#1000: honestly my motivation comes from wanting to make my dad and my grandparents proud. i didnt really grow up being able to see them much due to my mom being a very ||mentally unhealthy person, and unstable and abusive and some other things|| but now i live with them and ive never felt more loved, i just want to make them happy. and show them i can do it, even tho ive been through garbage.

[2021-04-23 18:20:59] (269776755328286720) Mange25#0600: ||The worst feeling in the world is knowing you did the best you could and it still wasn‚Äôt good enough.
It sucks, doesn‚Äôt it? Feeling like you‚Äôre not good enough.
Maybe I‚Äôm just not meant to live a happy life. Maybe pain is all I‚Äôll ever know.
No amount of sleep in the world could cure the tiredness I feel.
