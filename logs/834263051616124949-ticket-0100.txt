[2021-04-21 03:44:32] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: sorry i forgot this is a ticket and not a dm and was expecting a notification the entire time
[2021-04-21 03:44:42] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: ANYWAYS
[2021-04-21 03:45:32] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: for sure! go on!
[2021-04-21 03:45:51] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: those 2 people i was talking about
[2021-04-21 03:46:08] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: they're the only family I actually have an amount of love for
[2021-04-21 03:46:14] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: i think actually the only people
[2021-04-21 03:46:40] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: they live in another state and are basically a closed off section on my mother'
[2021-04-21 03:47:04] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: it's my mom's cousin and her husband
[2021-04-21 03:47:51] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: not long ago I tried to move in with them
[2021-04-21 03:47:58] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: i was putting in all or nothing
[2021-04-21 03:48:18] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: i'm not happy living with my mom
[2021-04-21 03:48:38] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: and i don't remember the last time i was as happy as when i was with them
[2021-04-21 03:49:00] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: they're eveything i wished my all of my family was
[2021-04-21 03:49:38] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: i represented the idea to her husband and he seemed opened to it, temporarily though
[2021-04-21 03:50:03] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: my mom's cousin on the other hand
[2021-04-21 03:50:47] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: i forgot to mention i've been suffering with suicidal thoughts for about 4 years
[2021-04-21 03:51:03] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: I recently started cutting
[2021-04-21 03:51:31] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: and I recently told them about this, i've been hiding all of that stuff from my family for forever
[2021-04-21 03:52:10] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: mhms :o
[2021-04-21 03:52:33] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: sorry i’m just letting you get it all before i say anything ^^ just wanted to let you know i’m actively listening !
[2021-04-21 03:52:55] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: yeah I know thank u
[2021-04-21 03:53:25] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: so anyways I just recently told my 2 family members about this since I knew my mom's cousin suffers from depression
[2021-04-21 03:55:33] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: and I told them my mom was making everything so much worse for me and that I wasn't happy living with her, that was my reason. My mom's cousin pretty much shut down the entire idea and tried to fix things with my mom instead. I only agreed to tell my mom about the suicide and cutting because I knew it wouldn't work out and then she'll finally see how bad it is for me.
[2021-04-21 03:56:38] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: things got worse and I went out to buy a type of over the counter drug that has the possibly to kill u in large doses
[2021-04-21 03:57:09] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: i feel like this kinda of getting confusing you're still on board right?
[2021-04-21 04:01:43] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: things got worse and I don't think they were really reacting the way I hoped they would. Instead I got the feeling they were putting the blame on me. Whenever i would talk about her they would seem to take her side , or make it seem like i'm all at fault
[2021-04-21 04:02:37] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: I wasn't sure if that was entirely true at that time but now that she's trying to improve and i'm basically making no efforts. I know i'm the only one to blame
[2021-04-21 04:04:22] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: the reason I was putting in all or nothing was because i promised myself if I failed, made everything worse, and damaged my relationship with them then I would kill myself
[2021-04-21 04:04:37] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: so when all hope felt lost I was carrying out that plan
[2021-04-21 04:04:56] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: I bought a type of over the counter drug that can kill you in large amounts
[2021-04-21 04:05:11] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: I wasn't gonna take out right after buying it though, i wanted to get ready before
[2021-04-21 04:05:14] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: so i hid
[2021-04-21 04:05:26] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: unfortunately my mom found them
[2021-04-21 04:05:36] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: and that's when she started improving
[2021-04-21 04:07:05] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: i’m so sorry i have to go for a bit, feel free to ping for someone else or i will help you again when i return, sorry again
[2021-04-21 04:07:28] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: oh will you be back soon?
[2021-04-21 05:57:32] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: hello sorry i’m back, if you’d still like to talk i’m back, if not i can close the ticket for now ^^ you can always open another if you would like to talk again!
[2021-04-21 06:00:34] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: i guess I can talk a little more, I opened another ticket while you were away and it just ended
[2021-04-21 06:02:05] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: it’s up to you!
[2021-04-21 06:04:17] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: have you read my other messages yet?
[2021-04-21 06:05:02] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: the one above? yes
[2021-04-21 06:05:36] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: I think i'm done explaining all of that
[2021-04-21 06:05:50] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: what would be your say on it
[2021-04-21 06:08:57] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: well i see you are definitely in a tough spot, of course the first thing i’d suggest is some form of therapy, if it’s unavailable a hotline or helpline could really do you good. i’ve had depression for years and i understand it’s not easy and it’s really easy to get stuck in your head. my honest say would be it gets better into adulthood, where you can move out and be yourself, i know it may seem far away but it’s worth it
[2021-04-21 06:09:58] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: so what do I do sit around and suffer while waiting for adulthood to come?
[2021-04-21 06:12:09] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: i mean i'm not entirely against it, it's way easier and won't damage my relantionship with them
[2021-04-21 06:12:26] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: like i said, therapy, hotlines/helplines, and even school counselling are all options, is there some way to ask them to bring you to regular therapy ?
[2021-04-21 06:13:40] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: i'm already in therapy, I just want different perspectives plus I don't see my therapist often and we often drift into off topic
[2021-04-21 06:15:23] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: maybe it would help to make a list of things you want to talk about! or even asking them directly what things you should do to feel joy in life again:3! i personally enjoy art, drawing, it’s not exactly “worth living for” but it brings me a little bit of joy :3! maybe finding hobbies might help as well. it’s a lot of little things
[2021-04-21 06:16:04] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: me too but it's always a temporary distraction, do you think I should give up on the moving thing?
[2021-04-21 06:18:04] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: if it means a lot to you maybe give it one more honest shot, if not make the most of your current situation!
[2021-04-21 06:18:39] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: won't staying with my mom only bring more damage?
[2021-04-21 06:19:48] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: it might, but chasing after something that won’t happen will also hurt a lot, if you can move in with your cousin that’s the best situation, if not you have to try and make the most of the one you are in until you can move out
[2021-04-21 06:20:14] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: hopefully with therapy and trying to find other things you enjoy it won’t be as harmful to your health
[2021-04-21 06:22:20] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: but it feels so terrible to be living a life that I know could have been better, if there's even a slight chance why not try?
[2021-04-21 06:25:40] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: if that’s the case do what feels best for you, but also try to be happy in the present moment
[2021-04-21 06:30:49] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: I mean I guess thats why I have no desire to try for her
[2021-04-21 06:31:27] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: there’s no harm in focusing on yourself
[2021-04-21 06:36:42] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: how can I accurately convey my feelings to them without them immediately taking her side?
[2021-04-21 06:41:53] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: honestly that’s something that’s up to you, try writing a letter, that way you can say exactly what you need and you can practice your points
[2021-04-21 06:41:58] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: it’s also a good way to cope :3
[2021-04-21 06:47:36] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: Sometimes I do write
[2021-04-21 06:48:41] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: that’s good! it’s really healthy and a good way to cope:3!
[2021-04-21 06:55:10] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: But I guess what im trying to say is that im tired of just coping and waiting. They're everything i've ever wanted, a supportive family.
[2021-04-21 06:55:45] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: mhms, very understandable, i hope you get that!
[2021-04-21 21:17:45] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: hey Obsi, would you like me to close the ticket now?
[2021-04-22 06:24:21] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: <@645507952144285716> please let me know if i can close the ticket ^^
[2021-04-22 09:48:44] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: oh yeah woops
