[2021-04-09 18:03:48] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: and yeah someone was spamming stuff here and pinged everyone, we disabled pings for now
[2021-04-09 18:03:52] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: YESS, I'm so glad I got into it because I love it
[2021-04-09 18:04:03] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: nuuuu
[2021-04-09 18:04:25] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: He did this a lot. I got dangerously close to getting a B last semester because of it.
[2021-04-09 18:04:32] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: Cool cool, I've used php before. I really dislike html and css though. Now that I have someone working under me, I'll just give them any html/css task I might encounter.
[2021-04-09 18:04:42] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: PHP was my first "real" programming language
[2021-04-09 18:04:44] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: agreed, it's annoying
[2021-04-09 18:04:46] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: ayy
[2021-04-09 18:04:48] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: Still use it to this day
[2021-04-09 18:05:34] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: I'm currently writing tests for a php website thingy and doi g paired programming to migrate from php 7.3 to 8 as 7.3 is going into end of life this year
[2021-04-09 18:05:34] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: A memory leak is a pretty serious issue, but at the same time to get 30%, that's kind of too harsh
[2021-04-09 18:06:30] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: Yeah, I know it's serious, but he took off 70% and left a note saying "If this was your job, you'd be fired." which really hurt.
[2021-04-09 18:06:48] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: I think facebook uses PHP heavily, I'm not sure if they do still.
[2021-04-09 18:07:08] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: that seems really harsh
[2021-04-09 18:07:10] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: Lol fun!
[2021-04-09 18:07:23] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: it's *not* your job that's why you're learning lol
[2021-04-09 18:07:37] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: lol
[2021-04-09 18:07:41] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: but yeah, php is fun
[2021-04-09 18:07:47] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: Yeah, he was *really* harsh. Didn't like him one bit.
[2021-04-09 18:08:07] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: I went into this job with no knowledge of php but now I can understand and write tests for it, so it's amazing
[2021-04-09 18:10:09] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: Maybe there's truth to that, but generally speaking, Nah fam, because people run tests before deploying their code to catch mistakes like that. Maybe you'd be retrained or something along those like, your professor is tripping. Lol an engineer at Google messed up a system so bad that ended up costing a few million dollars to the company and he didn't get fired.
[2021-04-09 18:10:51] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: I know right, freaking ridiculous!
[2021-04-09 18:11:24] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: Yeah, I know, he had a habit of making really hyperbolic remarks like that. It also wasn't even that bad of an issue and I would have caught it if I'd maybe had 10 more minutes to work on it.
[2021-04-09 18:11:25] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: Oh that's awesome, maybe you could teach me a few things because I'm an idiot.
[2021-04-09 18:12:11] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: haha, I ain't that good
[2021-04-09 18:12:41] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: I forgot to delete one (1) pointer and apparently that's bad enough to warrant getting a 30% on a lab assignment. Oh well, I still got an A in the class.
[2021-04-09 18:12:57] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: that's so weird that you drop 70%
[2021-04-09 18:13:11] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: yeah that's a bit much
[2021-04-09 18:13:12] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: Ayy you aced up, you smart!! congrats!
[2021-04-09 18:13:15] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: more than a bit lol
[2021-04-09 18:13:46] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Mine just takes off 2% per mistake, which seems reasonable
[2021-04-09 18:13:57] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: I wonder if I have done anything like that (even though I use almost entirely locals)
[2021-04-09 18:15:25] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: Yeah, his manner of grading was all sorts of inconsistent. He'd take off huge points for small mistakes sometimes but ignore big ones other times.
[2021-04-09 18:16:06] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: at least it's over now though, hopefully you don't have to ever take him again
[2021-04-09 18:17:54] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: I won't, the two classes I took with him are the only classes he teaches <a:groovingcat:739934114920005703>
[2021-04-09 18:18:42] (555192022592520214) Wolfsbane Sys(Ram/Rams)#5811: Who pinged??

[2021-04-09 18:19:52] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: Yeah, it was just some run of the mill troll
[2021-04-09 18:23:15] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Oh is that why I had five pings

[2021-04-09 18:30:05] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: no, not at all.
[2021-04-09 18:34:56] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I can ping you if you want /j
[2021-04-09 18:35:13] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: But those weren’t really enjoyable pings
[2021-04-09 18:35:37] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: I was actually asleep when I got pinged and I have notifications off on my phone at night, so I only noticed after waking up
[2021-04-09 18:35:40] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Not quite sure why a troll would ping the mod roles tho not the smartest decision lmao
[2021-04-09 18:35:58] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: That would be implying trolls are smart enough to make smart decisions
[2021-04-09 18:36:01] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: i’ve seen that before like why bother with the mods that makes you caught faster-

[2021-04-11 22:32:13] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Well everything either reflects light giving a colour, or totally absorbed giving black, right?
[2021-04-11 22:32:13] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: ah, forgot that but isn't it black the combp
[2021-04-11 22:32:13] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: andy said it exactly right

[2021-04-11 22:32:50] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: don't know what I don
[2021-04-11 22:32:56] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: don't know

[2021-04-11 22:33:02] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: I still don't understand why the sky is blue though ;3;
[2021-04-11 22:33:14] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: Raise the flag
[2021-04-11 22:33:43] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah so essentially you have roygbiv which are all the spectrums of visible light. an object absorbs these spectrums and then what isn't absorbed is reflect back making things have color. so yeah you're right
[2021-04-11 22:34:11] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: Sky reflects the sea. No?
[2021-04-11 22:34:15] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: nu
[2021-04-11 22:34:33] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: it's like...something to do with how the light from the sun hits the atmosphere
[2021-04-11 22:34:36] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Light is scattered by the atmosphere, but blue light is scattered more and our eyes are more sensitive to blue light so the sky appears blue
[2021-04-11 22:34:38] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: its to do with wavelengths and shit
[2021-04-11 22:34:41] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: and then it bends and scatters
[2021-04-11 22:34:43] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: but I don't get it
[2021-04-11 22:35:01] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: so if we had better eyes the sky would be rainbow?
[2021-04-11 22:35:09] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Maybe
[2021-04-11 22:35:11] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: possibly
[2021-04-11 22:35:14] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: 0-0
[2021-04-11 22:35:17] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Or probably just white
[2021-04-11 22:35:22] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: ooooh
[2021-04-11 22:35:27] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: okay this makes a bit more sense
[2021-04-11 22:35:41] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: And minor note but light never bends.
[2021-04-11 22:35:55] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: no uhhhh refracts? is that the word?
[2021-04-11 22:36:05] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: like when traveling through different mediums the path changes
[2021-04-11 22:36:12] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: there are tons of colors that we can't see as humans because we only have 3 color receptors
[2021-04-11 22:36:41] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: I wish I had more color receptors ;3;
[2021-04-11 22:36:41] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Refraction is when light changes direction when passing between mediums of different density.
[2021-04-11 22:36:54] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: yes that's what I meant by bend
[2021-04-11 22:37:01] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: you can bend light in water
[2021-04-11 22:37:08] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: That's refraction
[2021-04-11 22:37:16] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Straight lines only, no bending m
[2021-04-11 22:37:23] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: mantis shrimp have 16 color receptors. pretty cool.
[2021-04-11 22:37:31] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It is impossible to make light bend as far as we know.

[2021-04-11 22:37:56] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Even black holes can't do it, they have to cheat.
[2021-04-11 22:38:03] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: bend light in a fiber optic cable
[2021-04-11 22:38:11] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Straight lines only
[2021-04-11 22:38:28] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Total internal refraction
[2021-04-11 22:38:38] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: no it bounces back and forth and stuff i think lksdjlakfj bing bing bing like dat
[2021-04-11 22:38:49] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It just appears to bend on a human scale
[2021-04-11 22:39:09] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: But it's actually lots of tiny straight lines changing the angle in steps
[2021-04-11 22:39:13] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: i submit

[2021-04-11 22:39:52] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Photons have no mass so any change in direction is instantaneous because they have no inertia.
[2021-04-11 22:40:07] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: interesting
[2021-04-11 22:40:12] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: I never understood how light acts both as a wave and a particle
[2021-04-11 22:40:24] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: like it go wheee but it also go badonkadonk
[2021-04-11 22:40:30] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It doesn't, it acts as a waveparticle.
[2021-04-11 22:40:43] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It never acts as both at the same time
[2021-04-11 22:40:48] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: One or the other
[2021-04-11 22:41:00] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: But you cannot know which it will act as until observed
[2021-04-11 22:41:00] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: that....confuses me more
[2021-04-11 22:41:09] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: And the whole idea of a waveparticle is just a model
[2021-04-11 22:41:13] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It works as light

[2021-04-11 22:41:41] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: isn't that when they pew pewed the lazer thing through two slits in foil? when watched it went through 1 but ignored it went through 2
[2021-04-11 22:41:49] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: ljkfdaljksafdjlk always keysmash
[2021-04-11 22:41:52] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Thinking of it as a wave in one scenario and a particle in another is just useful depending on what kind of maths you are wanting to do.
[2021-04-11 22:42:04] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: oh
[2021-04-11 22:42:06] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: maths
[2021-04-11 22:42:43] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: So if you're modelling the photoelectric effect, it's best to model it as particles because the energy packets are in discrete units.
[2021-04-11 22:43:17] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: But if you're doing the double slit interference experiment you need to model it as a wave because particles can't actually interfere like that
[2021-04-11 22:43:33] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: now sheldon...
[2021-04-11 22:43:56] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It's just whichever model is most useful at the time
[2021-04-11 22:44:06] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: And it's also a school thing too
[2021-04-11 22:44:44] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: The real modern model that's currently in use at the cutting edge of quantum physics is weird and confusing and needs like.... 8 PhD's to understand
[2021-04-11 22:44:48] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: I must have been at recess

[2021-04-11 22:45:19] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: The secret is nobody understands it really 🤣
[2021-04-11 22:45:22] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: I just remember the basic experiments and not why XD
[2021-04-11 22:45:25] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I don’t remember any physics, I haven’t taken it in four years

[2021-04-11 22:45:47] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Like we can explain some stuff but we're still not sure where a third of the matter in the universe is
[2021-04-11 22:46:09] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: what's the name of the...bohrs?

[2021-04-11 22:46:26] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: that
[2021-04-11 22:46:46] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: He's a scientist who did a lot of early work in quantum physics.
[2021-04-11 22:46:56] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: yes, he has a particle named after him
[2021-04-11 22:46:58] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Had a big argument with Einstein about the uncertainty principle.
[2021-04-11 22:47:00] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: or a molecule?
[2021-04-11 22:47:14] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: is was it a theory...
[2021-04-11 22:47:22] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: he's also famous for his model of the atom
[2021-04-11 22:47:42] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: maybe I'm thinking of someone else, I can't remember
[2021-04-11 22:48:06] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: The Bohr-Rutherford model.
[2021-04-11 22:48:06] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: ohhh do you mean heisenberg?
[2021-04-11 22:48:40] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Bohrium is named after him, the element.
[2021-04-11 22:48:46] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: it like holds quarks together
[2021-04-11 22:48:48] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: cause he's famous for the heisenberg uncertainty principle

[2021-04-11 22:49:36] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: it...might be?
[2021-04-11 22:49:43] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: It's derivative work on Einsteins theory of relativity
[2021-04-11 22:50:03] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It kind of is but then it also kind of isn't
[2021-04-11 22:50:26] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Like it uses lots of relativity for the mathematics proof

[2021-04-11 22:50:43] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: But the theory itself differs violently from what Einstein thought was true.

[2021-04-11 22:51:45] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It's probably boson. The exchange particle of the strong and weak nuclear force which hold quarks and nucleons together.
[2021-04-11 22:52:07] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: what is the theorem
[2021-04-11 22:52:31] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: The big argument about all the quantum stuff with regard to Einstein is....
[2021-04-11 22:52:41] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Einstein didn't like the uncertainty principle.
[2021-04-11 22:52:54] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Like..... Really *really* didn't like it.
[2021-04-11 22:53:11] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: yesssssssssssss that
[2021-04-11 22:53:11] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It did not sit well with him and he fought against it very strongly.
[2021-04-11 22:53:39] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Most famously against Bohr at the Solvay conference.
[2021-04-11 22:54:46] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Turns out that the uncertainty principle is 100% totally correct though.
[2021-04-11 22:54:56] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Well we think it probably is anyway
[2021-04-11 22:54:59] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: .....ironically
[2021-04-11 22:55:38] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: The famous example of the uncertainty principle is electron position and velocity
[2021-04-11 22:56:15] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: The more information you have about the position of an electron around a nucleus, the less you must know about its velocity
[2021-04-11 22:57:06] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Another famous example of uncertainty is Schrödinger's cat but that's more about superposition so it's not super relevant here.
[2021-04-11 22:58:02] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Also most people don't actually get the point or the key details of that cat right so sometimes people think they know but they don't really.
[2021-04-11 22:58:52] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: We're nosediving into the weird bits of physics I can't explain much longer 🤣

[2021-04-12 03:59:26] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Since you want to bring private work public I might as well start by telling you and the viewers you want the real story here. You got muted for posting inappropriate things in light general and earning 5 strikes to do so, then I dragged you in a private chat today to talk about how the first thing you said when you were unmuted is that the mods have “||daddy issues||” and you were being extremely disrespectful in <#750376381019586651> to talk about your behavior which truly seemed like you do not care at all to be here and shrugged off the fact that after 5 strikes the first thing you did on your unmuted return is to disrespect mods that work very hard to keep this place self. You broke the rules, got dealt your punishment, that you think is unfair (which it was)and now you’re here again to do what exactly ? You wanna be here that’s fine but act appropriate and follow the rules. the fact that In less than 48 hours you accumulated 6+ strikes and a chance you blew to redeem your self in a private mod ticket seems to me like you don’t give a shit about here so if you want to be here kindly prove it

[2021-04-12 09:58:46] (726689449995534387) The Flaming Phoenix#2474: it doesnt have to be big or anything. maybe you're really good at rping and you're proud of it

[2021-04-12 09:59:21] (726689449995534387) The Flaming Phoenix#2474: you're complex enough of a person that it is virtually impossible not to like anything about yourself
[2021-04-12 09:59:38] (829153199624552529) zoey.colette#3638: um its possible
[2021-04-12 10:00:38] (726689449995534387) The Flaming Phoenix#2474: alright. try this: if you think you can't like yourself, that means you're aware of your flaws
[2021-04-12 10:00:45] (726689449995534387) The Flaming Phoenix#2474: that's something to be proud of
[2021-04-12 10:00:54] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: My mom was down and we talked about Grandma, her mother. Mom liked that. She didn't have a talk about grandma in a long time

[2021-04-12 10:04:46] (726689449995534387) The Flaming Phoenix#2474: you know there are parts of you that are not good, and that means you have a really good idea of who you are as a person
[2021-04-12 10:04:58] (726689449995534387) The Flaming Phoenix#2474: that's not something a lot of people can realise
[2021-04-12 10:05:11] (829153199624552529) zoey.colette#3638: also understood

[2021-04-12 10:07:38] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: I think I'm a fun conversationalist but I can go for days without speaking to anyone
[2021-04-12 10:07:52] (726689449995534387) The Flaming Phoenix#2474: yes, like that
[2021-04-12 10:08:28] (726689449995534387) The Flaming Phoenix#2474: i tend to be judgemental and have high standards, but have a strong enough sense of self to know when im being judgemental
[2021-04-12 10:08:48] (829153199624552529) zoey.colette#3638: understood

[2021-04-12 10:13:48] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: Usually when that happens to me I have realized I had been carrying around that anger for years, not days

Some languages don't have any words for specific colours, and others draw the divisions at different points. The language you learn the colours of the rainbow in effects your perceptions of colour.

[2021-04-12 22:12:02] (799410612333182996) TheFrostQueen❄#7887: Nope. I do that sometimes. They are from you’re creation/mind after all
[2021-04-12 22:13:10] (651068724304019506) SM_Dark#5993: but if you like, made a unique device or smth, would that be considered as ur 'child'
[2021-04-12 22:13:36] (799410612333182996) TheFrostQueen❄#7887: Oh you mean like technology?
[2021-04-12 22:15:59] (799410612333182996) TheFrostQueen❄#7887: It’s you’re brain child (I think that’s how the saying goes) so it’s not weird to refer to it that way

[2021-04-12 22:17:58] (651068724304019506) SM_Dark#5993: yea but they r living things too
[2021-04-12 22:22:30] (829153199624552529) zoey.colette#3638: When people with pets take the title of “parent” and blur the line between pets and children, our language is distorted in a way that only adds to our confusion and anxiety. It may be a gentle delusion to think of your pet as your “child,” but it’s still a delusion. Misnaming our relationship with pets isn’t just a lighthearted goof.

[2021-04-12 22:31:28] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: 1. it's allows us to know what pronouns to address you by
2. it can show what disorders you have (ofc only if you're comfortable sharing)
3. it allows you to join certain ping-able groups, for example support
4. it can help display what general timezone you're in
5. it can give you access to certain channels

[2021-04-13 15:17:22] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: I see people with like 400

[2021-04-13 15:22:53] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: i dont understand how people can handle that many pings personally, hearing like- five in a row scares me

[2021-04-13 15:32:26] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: But nothing seems to be working as well anymore
[2021-04-13 15:32:57] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: I wanna see my counsellor again but it’s currently hard to do so
[2021-04-13 15:32:59] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: sometimes it can feel that way, im not entirely sure what it is myself but i believe youre just perhaps getting used to the feel if that makes sense?
[2021-04-13 15:33:10] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: ohh i get that, corona hits hard at the moment
[2021-04-13 15:33:18] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: I thought I’ve been fine for a year or two now
[2021-04-13 15:33:36] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: But I kinda had the realization that I’m sad all the time. And it’s become the new normal again
[2021-04-13 15:34:07] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: well before you felt sad all the time, what was the difference?
[2021-04-13 15:34:29] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: maybe it was a sort of change that you havent considered yet, ive had moments like those
[2021-04-13 15:34:33] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: I don’t remember that’s the kicker

I was being hunted by men and the old man got some smugglers that would bring me out libia and to Britian. So after going on the boat and going to Britian we got attacked by the men seeking for me. Long story short I joined the military to fight back these men and my father was one of the attackers and cut off my hand during one of the attacks. Im just thankful for being alive and even with my ptsd.

[2021-04-14 02:33:07] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: I once locked myself in a cage with a dog
[2021-04-14 02:33:18] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: The dog was very tini and fluffy
[2021-04-14 02:33:23] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: And I was 4

[2021-04-14 02:34:02] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: im personally a sucker for corners and small spaces, i usually feel safest there
[2021-04-14 02:34:47] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: dark corners with a blanket ar safe
[2021-04-14 02:34:53] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: exactly
[2021-04-14 02:34:58] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Adahabaha
[2021-04-14 02:35:27] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: man that sounds really nice right now but i need my music atm to distract myself
[2021-04-14 02:35:40] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: bright makes me uncomfy
and when i'm in an open space hiding is hard
~~basically normal houses feel unsafe~~
[2021-04-14 02:35:47] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: I have reddit videos in the background
[2021-04-14 02:36:15] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: I feel unsafe because my house has giant windows, and 2 are next to my bed.
[2021-04-14 02:36:23] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: i get that, sometimes i flip flop with lighting, depends on whos around me i think? that i dont understand quite yet
[2021-04-14 02:36:39] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: ours is all first floor and mom insists we have the windows open until it's super dark
[2021-04-14 02:36:58] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: and the windows fill almost the entire wall
[2021-04-14 02:37:10] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: oh that would make me uneasy,, my parents are paranoid and cover all the windows
[2021-04-14 02:37:28] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: sadly their paranioa traveled to me
[2021-04-14 02:37:35] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Hence I have dog
[2021-04-14 02:37:36] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: yeah if i have my room's door open or windows open we feel pretty unsafe
[2021-04-14 02:37:46] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Dog makes me feel safe
[2021-04-14 02:38:07] (766014315228168244) Seaweedsplat#4734: Why did my tablet disconnect from the internet for a bit aaa
[2021-04-14 02:38:13] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: i cannot have my door open, that makes me uneasy and ive got animals in my room that.. cant exactly leave
[2021-04-14 02:38:40] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: my cats are too small and i live in the woods, if they get loose id probably never see them again
[2021-04-14 02:38:43] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: every time parents walk by they tell us to leave it open
[2021-04-14 02:38:44] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Only my dog allowed in my room at night, cat eats my bed.
[2021-04-14 02:38:56] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: **cats eat beds??**
[2021-04-14 02:39:05] (766014315228168244) Seaweedsplat#4734: I always want to close my door but that leaves me fearing my parents busting in with no warning to do something so yeah
[2021-04-14 02:39:09] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: we're waiting for the day an alter comes and yells at them
[2021-04-14 02:39:21] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Here I'll post a photo <#714573685431730207>
[2021-04-14 02:39:41] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: speaking of cats, ones just crushing my keybaord
[2021-04-14 02:39:51] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: There we go

[2021-04-14 02:40:19] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: *fuck me...*
*the clipboard noise is back*
*help*
[2021-04-14 02:40:22] (766014315228168244) Seaweedsplat#4734: usually just like I want my door closed but I don’t want to be alone but somebody else in my room drives me up the wall because *dude that’s my stuff*
[2021-04-14 02:40:24] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: mine usually likes to eat tape, i dont hang things on my wall
[2021-04-14 02:40:32] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: ?_?
[2021-04-14 02:40:47] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: whats bad about it? do you wanna share?
[2021-04-14 02:41:07] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: idk

or walking
etc

Yeap I'm with you there
[2021-04-14 02:41:31] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: hmm.. you can try humming to yourself
[2021-04-14 02:41:55] (766014315228168244) Seaweedsplat#4734: <:HeartGivingPengu:798783648086229022>
[2021-04-14 02:41:58] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: I got voices, and incoherent whispering
[2021-04-14 02:42:03] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: same here
[2021-04-14 02:42:18] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Sounds like someone's psspspspsps in my ear
[2021-04-14 02:42:26] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: once in awhile ill hear some.. odd screaming of my name but it feels so faint? its hard to explain
[2021-04-14 02:43:16] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: one time i swore i heard the tv play fireflies but when i checked it out, nothing was on
[2021-04-14 02:43:46] (766014315228168244) Seaweedsplat#4734: I don’t get that, I usually find real things to jump at (such as somebody being in the hallway or the sounds of *those shows* that I don’t like)
[2021-04-14 02:44:06] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: valid,
[2021-04-14 02:44:20] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: I see animals and people too, one time I thought there was dog in The road and nearly went off the road.
[2021-04-14 02:44:30] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: That- 
Hasn't happened since...
[2021-04-14 02:44:32] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: ill have moments like that where i just randomly jump because someone was in the hallway
[2021-04-14 02:44:58] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: and i hope it doesnt happen again for your sake, its a weird thing to happen and can make you antsy
[2021-04-14 02:45:11] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: sounds like someone saying "hey kid, hey, hey, hey kid"
repeatedly over and over
then when i finally acknowledge it it just says i'm a failure or smth and goes back to the hey kid
[2021-04-14 02:45:23] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Yeah, now it's usually people, like walking from their houses. Then they suddenly vanish.
[2021-04-14 02:45:50] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: thats odd,,
[2021-04-14 02:45:56] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: well- both are odd
[2021-04-14 02:46:07] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: and i know it's not an alter
[2021-04-14 02:46:14] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: My voices tend to fit the scene I'm in, and I answe them, and people look at me like I'm nuts.
[2021-04-14 02:46:19] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: i recall seeing some sort of- white figure crawl on my ceiling and go into the bathroom
[2021-04-14 02:46:33] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: same thing disappeared under my bed once
[2021-04-14 02:46:45] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Again, I wanted to talk about this earlier before work now I am
[2021-04-14 02:46:51] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: T wT
[2021-04-14 02:46:51] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: i never leave the house so that's the only one i really hear
sometimes they'll do some other stuff too
commenting on things
[2021-04-14 02:47:21] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: none of them are other alters
[2021-04-14 02:47:40] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: so idk at this point
[2021-04-14 02:48:00] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: These realistic voices have been around for 2-3 days now?...
[2021-04-14 02:48:02] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: maybe its a memory toying with you? im not exactly sure
[2021-04-14 02:48:09] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: They're getting the better of me to say the least
[2021-04-14 02:48:23] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: thats good
[2021-04-14 02:48:26] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: we dont have any memories of any of the stuff like that though so
[2021-04-14 02:48:40] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: ?????
[2021-04-14 02:49:01] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: oh did i misunderstand- i took it as a way that the voices are fading away
[2021-04-14 02:49:07] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Oop
[2021-04-14 02:49:17] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: That okay
[2021-04-14 02:49:27] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: i hope so,, sorry for the misunderstanding
[2021-04-14 02:49:34] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: It good
[2021-04-14 02:49:53] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: I got a therapy app tmrw.
[2021-04-14 02:50:03] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Hoping ican speak up
[2021-04-14 02:50:03] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: oohh! i hope it goes well
[2021-04-14 02:50:12] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: I'll also see people who I know aren't there when I'm out and about taking notes then glancing at me taking notes repeat
[2021-04-14 02:50:18] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: youve got this friend!
[2021-04-14 02:50:57] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: its odd how your mind can toy with you,, do you have any ideas on why they maybe showing up?
[2021-04-14 02:50:58] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Oh oh!!! I was taking the psat at my school, and I kept seeing this lady out the corner of Mt eye just WATCJING me take the test.
[2021-04-14 02:51:07] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: eh no idea
[2021-04-14 02:51:51] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: She didn't exist either
[2021-04-14 02:52:06] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: sadly seeing and hearing things arent things i have a specialty to deal with, so im trying to figure out random little things and link them together
[2021-04-14 02:52:22] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Yea
[2021-04-14 02:52:33] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Brain whu

[2021-04-14 02:53:50] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: Mine will be there and act like normal people, usually they'll disappear into a building after a bit
[2021-04-14 02:54:27] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Mine go away after a few mins, and then my brain hurts cause I thought it was real
[2021-04-14 02:54:43] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Like, my classmate wasn't at school that day, they sit next to me
[2021-04-14 02:54:54] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: And a hallucination filled the seat
[2021-04-14 02:55:06] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: It took me half the class period to realize
[2021-04-14 02:55:20] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: No one was there
[2021-04-14 02:55:44] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: But now we virtual and I gotta deal with random in my room corner

an in depth game like Mafia or murder mystery, I had an idea with my friends a while ago with tons of details.

Or, a game that explores mental health through the eyes of different characters. The game would carry you through the lives of tons of characters, in a 2d story like an interactive visual novel.

[2021-04-14 14:13:55] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Really depends on where you live. Spanish is useless in Canada, but French is one of our primary langauges.

[2021-04-15 00:19:56] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Random question ik
[2021-04-15 00:20:34] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Definitely not. We are not a fan.

[2021-04-15 00:30:27] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: no idea what streched lobes are
[2021-04-15 00:30:44] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: You know ear piercings?

[2021-04-15 00:32:11] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i don't have them but they're cool in my opinion. to each their own.
[2021-04-15 00:32:13] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Do not like the aesthetic. In our opinion it looks foolish to have these big dangly plate-like things in a person's ears. Earrings are cool and can add a lot to a person's appearance, no doubt some people believe stretched lobes are similar, but they just don't vibe with us.
[2021-04-15 00:33:11] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: I got you Alora, the bug ones some times look a lil off

[2021-04-15 01:42:46] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: i find that oddly funny, im glad its only doing that though!
[2021-04-15 01:43:14] (825392044779503636) DinoGameDev#1621: Yeah
[2021-04-15 01:43:59] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: I'm confused
[2021-04-15 01:44:15] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: well because you have to be a minimum of 13 to be on discord so you would be between 13-16
[2021-04-15 01:44:33] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: 6ea
[2021-04-15 01:44:35] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Yea
[2021-04-15 01:44:54] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: the reason we have a 16-17 role is we can tell who is old enough to apply for mod or private support
[2021-04-15 01:45:02] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Aaah
[2021-04-15 01:45:06] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: i worry for the children that have discord,, here can be a scary place if you dont know what youre doing

[2021-04-15 01:45:30] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: i just wish for the kiddens to be safe
[2021-04-15 01:45:45] (825392044779503636) DinoGameDev#1621: Oh ok, yeah anypne under wouldn’t be very mature or have time-

[2021-04-15 01:46:24] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: and even if they could, taht could set up an unhealthy cycle for them that they think is normal, when its not
[2021-04-15 01:46:33] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: ohh luckkyy lmao
[2021-04-15 01:46:50] (825392044779503636) DinoGameDev#1621: Oh yeah, I was dumb and had discord when I was under 13, (not anymore) and had depression for a year, turned me into some introverted kid nobody knows.

[2021-04-15 01:47:18] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Discord is not really better or worse than anywhere else on the internet, for people who don't know what they're doing.
[2021-04-15 01:47:26] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: mhm

[2021-04-15 01:49:55] (825392044779503636) DinoGameDev#1621: I was like that when I was 12, I never told my parents so I never had real therapy, unless you count Roblox servers that have therapy sessions.
[2021-04-15 01:50:03] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Oooooh e

[2021-04-15 01:50:48] (825392044779503636) DinoGameDev#1621: True
[2021-04-15 01:50:49] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We like to read non-fiction books. Books about biology, psychology, mental health, and stuff like that. Super interesting to us.
[2021-04-15 01:51:17] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: those are interesting topics yea! i wish i could stay on task n focus on it more, maybe one day
[2021-04-15 01:51:24] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: Good morning! Ooh we talking about books?
[2021-04-15 01:51:26] (825392044779503636) DinoGameDev#1621: I wanna read about biology, mostly animals and insects more than humans.
[2021-04-15 01:51:28] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Ooh cool! I have to start reading psychology and mental health books for writing and personal purposes oof

[2021-04-15 01:53:14] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: If we're talking about mental health books, I have this entire list from a therapist Youtuber I watch.
[2021-04-15 01:53:41] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Weeee

[2021-04-15 01:54:30] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: Cool, I'll go get it and post it in <#816981072855695370>.
[2021-04-15 01:54:42] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Psych2go on YouTube is a nice relaxing channel
[2021-04-15 01:54:57] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: Oh, I love Psych2Go too!
[2021-04-15 01:55:02] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: <:redpandaheart:809267930340655175>
[2021-04-15 01:55:15] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: ~~Psych2go upsets me because I got too into it oof~~
[2021-04-15 01:55:22] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Oop
[2021-04-15 01:55:34] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We like Sapolsky because he has a very holistic view of how our body works and why we behave the way we do. He doesn't teach anyone how to manage their mental health, but he certainly present a very in-depth view of all the factors that go into mental and physical health.
[2021-04-15 01:55:41] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: Sa=hi
[2021-04-15 01:55:45] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Neuropsychoimmunology is something he talks about a lot.
[2021-04-15 01:55:50] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. 😦
[2021-04-15 01:55:51] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Hiiiii sal
[2021-04-15 01:56:06] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: Hi Sal! What is that, Alora? 😮
[2021-04-15 01:56:39] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: It’s oki! Totally my fault haha, I’ll probably watch them again tho for educational purposes when I work on character development (as a writer)
[2021-04-15 01:56:50] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: It is the study of how our brain and body are a lot more connected than we thought.
[2021-04-15 01:57:50] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: I think I just ate a stand of hair
[2021-04-15 01:58:38] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: He has a speech/presentation about one of his books *Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers* that is really cool. He talks about how we activate our stress response for all sorts of things that it was never designed for, and this can lead to all sorts of different imbalances and illnesses later in life.
[2021-04-15 01:59:32] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: Wow, that does sound very interesting. 😮
[2021-04-15 01:59:37] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Does
[2021-04-15 01:59:41] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Yes
[2021-04-15 02:00:56] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: <a:excite:798783663235661844>
[2021-04-15 02:01:52] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: I gotta admit though, even though I've been committed to read more actual books, all I'm doing lately is reading fanfics from Ao3. 🤣
[2021-04-15 02:02:20] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Ik the fanfic life
[2021-04-15 02:02:31] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: I am le fanfic author lol
[2021-04-15 02:02:40] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Not on Ao3 of course but
[2021-04-15 02:02:46] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Wattpad.
[2021-04-15 02:02:51] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: <:FoxSigh:800030319264137308>
[2021-04-15 02:03:34] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Some ao3 is quality tho 
I don’t really like most wattpad stories that I’ve encountered but I like the publishing opportunities for original fiction
[2021-04-15 02:04:00] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Yeah
[2021-04-15 02:04:27] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: Woohoo! I'm not into Wattpad either, my go-to site is Ao3 because it's so user-friendly. But I also used to write fanfic, did about 2 last year. 🙂
[2021-04-15 02:04:35] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: I have a teaser for an original fiction story on my account for people to read lol
[2021-04-15 02:05:20] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Which I'm not going to talk about here because it would be major triggering
[2021-04-15 02:05:53] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: That’s how all the books I try to write are 😅
[2021-04-15 02:06:02] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Me too lol
[2021-04-15 02:08:35] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: I mean, quite a number of things I write are the same too. 🤷 I did write a slice of life romance story once however, it was relaxing to write and surprisingly well-received.
[2021-04-15 02:08:44] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Nice
[2021-04-15 02:08:50] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: everything i try to write doesn't exist because i give up on everything before i try
[2021-04-15 02:08:55] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Oh-
[2021-04-15 02:09:12] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I get that, I’m trying to stick to one idea
[2021-04-15 02:10:27] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: One of my favourite pieces of writing advice is, writing begins with forgiveness. Forgive yourself if you can't write every single day, or for that first draft that's less than ideal.
[2021-04-15 02:11:20] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Yesss first drafts are meant to be bad, just get the ideas on paper/computer
[2021-04-15 02:11:55] (825392044779503636) DinoGameDev#1621: I kinda write stories
[2021-04-15 02:12:11] (825392044779503636) DinoGameDev#1621: when I develop a game, I write out stories- if that counts that is
[2021-04-15 02:13:52] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We go on writing sprees. We'll write a story every day for like 4-8 hours a day and fill up 300 pages in our little journals. Then just throw it out when we're done because we don't care about it anymore.
[2021-04-15 02:14:11] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: Oof
[2021-04-15 02:14:46] (825392044779503636) DinoGameDev#1621: Who’s we-
[2021-04-15 02:14:56] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We use first-person plural pronouns.

[2021-04-15 12:21:41] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: Those are good ideas, Lilac cat, Hecate! Only problem is, I can't cook. My usual approach is to give him something he needs/wants but this man is too good at following the maxim, "treat yoself". Like, I'd planned to give him a gift card to a bookstore 'cos I noticed he was running low on books to read. But he came home yesterday with a whole pile of new books so.

[2021-04-15 12:23:26] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: Maybe try giving him something he can’t get 🤔. First thing that comes to mind is a drawing, since you’re so amazing at it.

[2021-04-15 12:28:43] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: Action films, Chinese music,  basic PC games like Spider Solitaire and Mahjong... 🤔 Slightly spicy food maybe?
[2021-04-15 12:29:17] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: I have to say though, he's a bit of a picky eater.

[2021-04-15 12:30:34] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: I suppose I could make him a card and write my sentiments in it, but I did that last year during lockdown. 🤔

[2021-04-15 12:31:42] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: On top of that, maybe you could pay for him to go to the spa? Though, he doesn’t sound like the type of person who’d be into that
[2021-04-15 12:33:44] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: I wish he was, lol. He has a bad back and would benefit a lot from that. Instead he just buys these little cushions and put them everywhere.
[2021-04-15 12:35:04] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: Ok, I will make him another card. Just wondering what else I can do. 🤔
[2021-04-15 12:35:25] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: What time is it there?
[2021-04-15 12:36:54] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: It's 8:30 pm. Not to worry though, my dad's birthday is 12 days away, I still have time.
[2021-04-15 12:37:33] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: Oh okay cool, I was gonna suggest that maybe you could do a breakfast in bed type of this, to go along with the card.
[2021-04-15 12:38:17] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: Since it’s twelve days away, if anything else comes to mind I’ll just dm you.
[2021-04-15 12:39:24] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: Hmmm I could easily make the half boiled eggs and oatmeal he usually eats for breakfast. If I can beat my mom to it that is, she tends to rise with the sun.
[2021-04-15 12:39:49] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: And ok, thanks! 😄

[2021-04-15 12:45:01] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: If he's getting a bit older you could gift him a really nice garden kneeler?

"im glad to see more people use it"
while to put it another way "im glad more people are using it" 
"using" for this means its currently being done while "use" means more of like.. has been used or is about to be used if that makes sense?

[2021-04-16 08:10:06] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: Thanks ddddeen. ☺️ 🫂
[2021-04-16 08:10:39] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: proofreader?
[2021-04-16 08:10:46] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: you can study that?
[2021-04-16 08:11:29] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: Yes, in fact, you can't even get your foot in the door for publishing powerhouses without the proper training.
[2021-04-16 08:12:30] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: It's one of those jobs everyone with good English thinks they can do... until they realise they haven't the foggiest what the terminology means or how to use the proofreading symbols.
[2021-04-16 08:13:01] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It's probably a thing where someone with good English can probably proofread an essay being submitted to school
[2021-04-16 08:13:16] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: But suddenly someone wants to make millions from publishing this book and now you're way out of your depth
[2021-04-16 08:13:22] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: That about right?
[2021-04-16 08:14:02] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: Yup
[2021-04-16 08:14:03] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It must be fatiguing too, reading all that text all day.
[2021-04-16 08:14:39] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: The more I think about it, actually that's a difficult and specialised job.
[2021-04-16 08:15:04] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: Not really. I mean, I kinda love reading as long as I don't have to put my proofreader cap on. I could spend my nose buried in a good fanfic all day.
[2021-04-16 08:16:12] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: It can be quite specialised, yes. Like, there are specific requirements, for example, for being a legal or medical proofreader. But thank goodness I'm not going into those fields.
[2021-04-16 08:17:01] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: Annndddd oops, I just made a mistake typing a message. Blergh. I'm not usually this bad.
[2021-04-16 08:30:17] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It's fine, everyone makes mistakes.
[2021-04-16 08:34:25] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: I mean I make mistakes in my models all the time.
[2021-04-16 08:34:51] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: Yeah, but I gotta be more careful sometimes. If that had been me liaising with a potential client or interviewer, it could've cost me. 🤔
[2021-04-16 08:35:48] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Good thing it was only here then 😊

[2021-04-16 08:58:42] (279266238595858432) anzu68 (team parzu)#2459: I like the name
[2021-04-16 08:59:03] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: Nice to see you too, anzu! 🙂 👋 Thanks, I also like my name and what it means.
[2021-04-16 08:59:11] (279266238595858432) anzu68 (team parzu)#2459: what does it mean if I may ask?
[2021-04-16 09:00:08] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: Akira is 'dawn/illumination' in Japanese. It's also a little nod to the Japanese phrase 'akiramenai!' (Don't give up!)
[2021-04-16 09:00:22] (279266238595858432) anzu68 (team parzu)#2459: ooo I love it
[2021-04-16 09:00:41] (279266238595858432) anzu68 (team parzu)#2459: does akira menai mean await the dawn literally? I'm asking since it reminds me of the Green 'mene' which means 'Await!'

[2021-04-16 09:05:59] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: No, akiramenai (諦めない) uses a different word as its base than the word that signifies dawn (明). I just enjoy my wordplay. 😅

Sometimes I type up the translation, other times I just keep it in a notebook. I've recently typed up the Antigone and I'm typing up Herodotus at the moment as well
[2021-04-16 09:17:20] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: Wow ok 😮 ✨ So you're versed in the Classics? A Renaissance man.

[2021-04-16 09:49:07] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: SUMMER

    The hot warm and the nice winds hit with everything, its summer again. A coconut is in front of me, with its rough texture and nice white inside, almost like a division that was meant to exist to protect the inside of it. I look at the table and I see the shiny cutlery with all it's elegance almost calling me to pick it up and analyse the details and the curves closer. I hear birds in the sky singing a song for someone, and I imagine how would be nice if all the melody was meant just for me, just singing again for them. The ducks quack, and I quack with them too, or try to, because I can't copy the elegance of the feathers or the divine diving they do from time to time. It's summer again, and I feel happy.

[2021-04-16 13:55:36] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: That's exciting. Do you two get to see each other in person often?
[2021-04-16 13:55:55] (279266238595858432) anzu68 (team parzu)#2459: this will be the first meeting since we're long distance so am super excited

[2021-04-16 13:57:16] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Ah that is really cool. We met our ex online. They lived in the US and us in Canada, so it was a pain in the ass to meet up, but we did eventually. They moved to Canada, we got married and had kids. We're divorced now though.
[2021-04-16 13:58:13] (279266238595858432) anzu68 (team parzu)#2459: also a system? I'm assuming due to the we. And yeah I'm really excited to meet my gf

[2021-04-16 14:03:22] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Nothing. DID and OSDD have similar symptoms.
[2021-04-16 14:03:30] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We may have OSDD.

[2021-04-16 14:22:01] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: The hot warm and the nice winds hit with everything, its summer again. A coconut is in front of me, with its rough texture and nice white inside, almost like a division that was meant to exist to protect the inside of it. I look at the table and I see the shiny cutlery with all it's elegance almost calling me to pick it up and analyse the details and the curves closer. I hear birds in the sky singing a song for someone, and I imagine how would be nice if all the melody was meant just for me, just singing back again for them. The ducks quack, and I quack with them too, or try to, because I can't copy the elegance of the feathers or the divine diving they do from time to time. It's summer again, and I feel happy.
( can you all pls leave your opinion about this, like, how you have felt while reading? thnks...)

[2021-04-16 14:39:02] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: I open my eyes and I see the shiny little points in the sky called stars. I am laying in something soft but with a rough texture... its sand!. I don't want to stand, and, soon, the smell of the salty water come to my nose and the sound of the waves with it. I still look up, paying attention to the little sound, barely hearable because of the sound of the water crashing in the sand, I hear crabs walking in the sand and burring themselves under it. I open my eyes and see the stars again... ( srry if it's messy, I tried my best lol)

It has been shown to possibly exist in certain circumstances, but not in the way that it has been presented in homeopathy. Do not confuse the current theory of the fourth phase of water with the homeopathic explanation. They similar in some basic ways, but diverge quickly.

[2021-04-17 13:26:23] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: The first episode of Wanda vision was really confusing tbh
[2021-04-17 13:26:42] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I watched it and kinda spent the entire time confused lmao
[2021-04-17 13:26:46] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: the interconnection is amazing but also super confusing
[2021-04-17 13:26:46] (444537905919164428) Scythe#9417: the second one fairly confusing two
[2021-04-17 13:27:19] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I started getting an idea of what was happening as the times kept cha going but I won’t say any more cuz spoilers
[2021-04-17 13:27:30] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: The Daredevil Netflix series is still our favourite standalone. Such amazing fight scenes!

[2021-04-17 13:28:00] (709014659470196801) Ga14ctic#2758: Daredevil is a good series in my opinion
[2021-04-17 13:28:11] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I like iron fist
[2021-04-17 13:28:15] (709014659470196801) Ga14ctic#2758: ooooh
[2021-04-17 13:28:17] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Oof.
[2021-04-17 13:28:20] (709014659470196801) Ga14ctic#2758: Iron fist is also good
[2021-04-17 13:28:36] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Did you watch the one with all of them in?
[2021-04-17 13:28:37] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Iron Fist really missed the mark in our opinion.
[2021-04-17 13:28:40] (709014659470196801) Ga14ctic#2758: I like most of the marvel netflix ones
[2021-04-17 13:28:47] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I think it was called defenders
[2021-04-17 13:28:58] (709014659470196801) Ga14ctic#2758: I dont think so
[2021-04-17 13:29:01] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: The cinematography in Iron Fist was really lacking compared to Daredevil.
[2021-04-17 13:29:23] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I watched iron fist first
[2021-04-17 13:29:28] (709014659470196801) Ga14ctic#2758: Same
[2021-04-17 13:29:41] (709014659470196801) Ga14ctic#2758: I was really addicted to it for a good month
[2021-04-17 13:29:45] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: The Punisher was solid as well.
[2021-04-17 13:29:57] (709014659470196801) Ga14ctic#2758: I didnt enjoy Punisher as much
[2021-04-17 13:30:08] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I haven’t watched that one yet
[2021-04-17 13:30:22] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Yeah, not as great, but the actor they chose to play a Frank Castle did an excellent job.
[2021-04-17 13:30:36] (709014659470196801) Ga14ctic#2758: yeah, i agree
[2021-04-17 13:31:47] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: The Punisher and Daredevil are our favourites because both of them get hurt a lot. They aren’t invincible superheroes. They get hurt and then they get back up and go on. That attitude is inspiring to us.
[2021-04-17 13:32:31] (709014659470196801) Ga14ctic#2758: Yeah, that makes sense, although i like Iron Fist, because at most times the action is quite intense, and i love really intense stuff.
[2021-04-17 13:32:47] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I love how they portray people in marvel in general
[2021-04-17 13:32:55] (709014659470196801) Ga14ctic#2758: Same
[2021-04-17 13:32:59] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: They have their good and bad moments rather than just purely good
[2021-04-17 13:33:10] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We didn’t like the actor they chose to play Danny. He felt kinda whiny in the first season.
[2021-04-17 13:33:36] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Ooh yeah he was a little weird
[2021-04-17 13:34:58] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Luke Cage’s stand-alone series was pretty decent too, and the other one who’s name is currently escaping us. Jessica...
[2021-04-17 13:36:02] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: The choice for Kilgrave was really solid. We were just coming off a Doctor Who binge at the time so it was cool to see him okay someone evil.

[2021-04-19 11:44:13] (775310084313317386) Cadence#6541: The increased financial prosperity of the 1920s gave many Americans more disposable income to spend on entertaining themselves.
This influx of cash, coupled with advancements in technology, led to new patterns of leisure (time spent having fun) and consumption (buying products).
In this period, movies and sports became increasingly popular, while commercial radio and magazines turned athletes and actors into national icons. 
The 1920s was a decade of change, when many Americans owned cars, radios, and telephones for the first time.

[2021-04-20 00:49:23] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Almost all of biology is a spectrum.
[2021-04-20 00:49:26] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: or would that a moving thing
[2021-04-20 00:49:31] (224176266318708736) Parsey (team parzu)#0682: Maybe in the middle? Or maybe pacing up and down the spectrum?
[2021-04-20 00:49:46] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: wait where would non binary be then
[2021-04-20 00:49:48] (224176266318708736) Parsey (team parzu)#0682: So yeah, moving.
[2021-04-20 00:49:51] (224176266318708736) Parsey (team parzu)#0682: Hmmm
[2021-04-20 00:49:55] (224176266318708736) Parsey (team parzu)#0682: Maybe non-conforming?
[2021-04-20 00:49:56] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: non-binary is an umbrella term.
[2021-04-20 00:50:03] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i think it’s hard since there’s the gender binary

[2021-04-20 00:51:07] (825392044779503636) DinoDev#1621: some say it means you’re both at the same time
[2021-04-20 00:51:15] (224176266318708736) Parsey (team parzu)#0682: I guess I am non-binary but I also identify as female so I think I make no sense lol

[2021-04-20 00:52:25] (224176266318708736) Parsey (team parzu)#0682: But I don't do things just because a *female should* or *would*
[2021-04-20 00:52:27] (224176266318708736) Parsey (team parzu)#0682: If that makes sense?
[2021-04-20 00:52:27] (724929820726919180) Yuki_blue <3#2872: I kinda don't know my gender tho.
[2021-04-20 00:52:43] (224176266318708736) Parsey (team parzu)#0682: And often dress androgynously
[2021-04-20 00:52:47] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We usually just say we're non-binary, rather than get specific about it.

[2021-04-20 00:52:54] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Then people don't have so many expectations.

[2021-04-20 00:53:28] (825392044779503636) DinoDev#1621: Kinda feel bigender but never wanna be the other gender, just wanna feel like it for a short amount of time, ig that makes no sense

[2021-04-20 12:38:15] (771298856004223007) Marian_#7941: jar jar is the best
[2021-04-20 12:38:21] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: It’s refreshing being able to have an opinion on Star Wars
[2021-04-20 12:38:24] (771298856004223007) Marian_#7941: very popular opinion /s
[2021-04-20 12:38:26] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: Without being attacked
[2021-04-20 12:38:51] (723466293998518292) MiniRebel(Moose)#3182: Yesss
[2021-04-20 12:39:03] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: I swear every “hardcore” fan Essentially says they hate every movie
[2021-04-20 12:39:16] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: I’m like how are you a fan if you hate every movie
[2021-04-20 12:39:20] (771298856004223007) Marian_#7941: right
[2021-04-20 12:39:43] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: Is it perfect no
[2021-04-20 12:39:49] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: But it’s still fun to watch
[2021-04-20 12:39:53] (723466293998518292) MiniRebel(Moose)#3182: For sure
[2021-04-20 12:39:55] (771298856004223007) Marian_#7941: I also like 7, 8 and 9. the "pacing" is weird though, especially compared to the older ones
[2021-04-20 12:40:07] (723466293998518292) MiniRebel(Moose)#3182: Thank you!
[2021-04-20 12:40:32] (723466293998518292) MiniRebel(Moose)#3182: Everyone gets mad at me for liking the sequels tho I'm not a fan of Rey and Ben tbh
[2021-04-20 12:40:46] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: Also unfortunately I think a lot of sequel hate is internalized misogyny
[2021-04-20 12:41:01] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: How can Rey do any of that?
[2021-04-20 12:41:03] (771298856004223007) Marian_#7941: definitely
[2021-04-20 12:41:15] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: How can any of the main characters do anything
[2021-04-20 12:41:28] (723466293998518292) MiniRebel(Moose)#3182: Hmmm I've never seen it from that perspective
[2021-04-20 12:41:34] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: Luke blew up the Death Star with a perfect ship his first time flying
[2021-04-20 12:41:56] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: He took years to master the Force tho
[2021-04-20 12:42:11] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: Rey just needed hours
[2021-04-20 12:42:19] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: The biggest things I saw was they didn’t like how she could fly the falcon and how she was good at saber fighting
[2021-04-20 12:42:24] (723466293998518292) MiniRebel(Moose)#3182: THE FORCE
[2021-04-20 12:42:37] (771298856004223007) Marian_#7941: i think the sequels just suffered from having two different creative minds at the top with very different visions (jj abrams and ryan johnson)
[2021-04-20 12:42:40] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: She used a staff her whole life with easily carries over to sword like combat
[2021-04-20 12:42:59] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: The force isn’t an excuse for OP characters
[2021-04-20 12:43:09] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: Also I hate that, the force can’t be used every time something happens
[2021-04-20 12:43:19] (723466293998518292) MiniRebel(Moose)#3182: True
[2021-04-20 12:43:33] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: The force doesn’t just make luke the best pilot
[2021-04-20 12:43:41] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: Pretty much
[2021-04-20 12:43:47] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: He used the force on the shot to blow up the Death Star
[2021-04-20 12:43:52] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: Not to pilot the ship
[2021-04-20 12:43:58] (723466293998518292) MiniRebel(Moose)#3182: True
[2021-04-20 12:44:10] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: So it’s just like when guys do it, it’s fine
[2021-04-20 12:44:19] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: But when Rey can do something it’s like how
[2021-04-20 12:44:34] (723466293998518292) MiniRebel(Moose)#3182: The force is used to justify like everything tho
[2021-04-20 12:44:36] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: Like idk maybe her being a scavenger and flying around in the atmosphere
[2021-04-20 12:44:58] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: She never claims to be the best pilot to exist she just knows how to fly
[2021-04-20 12:45:09] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: It’s not
[2021-04-20 12:45:21] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: It’s just lazy writing
[2021-04-20 12:45:32] (723466293998518292) MiniRebel(Moose)#3182: That makes sense too
[2021-04-20 12:45:50] (723466293998518292) MiniRebel(Moose)#3182: This has been a very refreshing convo
[2021-04-20 12:45:55] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: To be honest I think it's just that the sequels aren't that well written or directed or managed, and then people just blame the characters for it.
[2021-04-20 12:45:56] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: 🙂
[2021-04-20 12:46:08] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: Honestly I like them for what they are
[2021-04-20 12:46:16] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: They aren’t my favourite but I don’t dislike them
[2021-04-20 12:46:21] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: That’s fair.
[2021-04-20 12:46:30] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: There are key elements I would change however
[2021-04-20 12:46:32] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: A lot of the stuff in the sequels was pretty good or had lots of potential, and other stuff was just not.
[2021-04-20 12:47:14] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: I think the two different creative minds was a big issue too yeah.
[2021-04-20 12:47:18] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: My prime ending would be that Rey kept the palpatine name
[2021-04-20 12:47:32] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Ryan Johnson is a great director, but his style just doesn't suit the relative simplicity of SW.
[2021-04-20 12:47:34] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: Only to show the galaxy being a sith is not an absolute
[2021-04-20 12:47:39] (723466293998518292) MiniRebel(Moose)#3182: The plot had loads of potential but low execution I guess
[2021-04-20 12:47:44] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Yep.
[2021-04-20 12:47:54] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: Someone with a name as powerful as that would be awesome to be seen as a Jedi name later on
[2021-04-20 12:48:01] (771298856004223007) Marian_#7941: to be honest, I think they're very, very well directed. Writing and management are questionable, I agree. But both abrams and johnson managed to "depict" their vision really well.
[2021-04-20 12:48:06] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It could have been good, but the Disney execs ruined it because they wanted money and pandering instead of quality and.
[2021-04-20 12:48:17] (723466293998518292) MiniRebel(Moose)#3182: Have you ever had to convince someone that star wars isn't set in the future even though it has all that tech
[2021-04-20 12:48:22] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: I loved rouge one
[2021-04-20 12:48:29] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: And the solo movie
[2021-04-20 12:48:30] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: Disney ruins everything.
[2021-04-20 12:48:43] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: My thing is that, Johnson made a really good Ryan Johnson movie, but Ryan Johnson movies don't suit Star Wars.
[2021-04-20 12:48:50] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: The Star Wars films are actually pretty simple.
[2021-04-20 12:48:53] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: The person who played young Han did a crazy good job capturing Harrison ford
[2021-04-20 12:49:01] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Ryan Johnson is such a subversive director.
[2021-04-20 12:49:07] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Just doesn't suit it well.
[2021-04-20 12:49:09] (723466293998518292) MiniRebel(Moose)#3182: I haven't heard if his movies before?
[2021-04-20 12:49:29] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Plus, him ripping up the script that JJ had for E8 and making the entire plot fall apart because the execs wanted him to definitely ruined stuff.
[2021-04-20 12:49:34] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: He's done some really good ones.
[2021-04-20 12:49:55] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: He did Rogue One.
[2021-04-20 12:50:02] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Which was way better than E8.
[2021-04-20 12:50:12] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: ||Knives out|| is absolutely amazing.
[2021-04-20 12:50:16] (723466293998518292) MiniRebel(Moose)#3182: Hey that one was Pretty good
[2021-04-20 12:50:29] (723466293998518292) MiniRebel(Moose)#3182: I've been meaning to watch that
[2021-04-20 12:50:36] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: I won't ruin it.
[2021-04-20 12:50:39] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: But it's so good.
[2021-04-20 12:50:46] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: *That's* a good Ryan Johnson film.
[2021-04-20 12:50:47] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: Yes
[2021-04-20 12:50:47] (723466293998518292) MiniRebel(Moose)#3182: One of my friends saw it and wouldn't stop recommending it
[2021-04-20 12:50:50] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: It’s awesome
[2021-04-20 12:50:50] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: He just doesn't suit Star Wars.
[2021-04-20 12:51:03] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: In my total honest opinion
[2021-04-20 12:51:10] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: Any ending people would be mad about
[2021-04-20 12:51:17] (771298856004223007) Marian_#7941: The same goes for JJ Abrams btw
[2021-04-20 12:51:23] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: I think they were a mistake in the first place.
[2021-04-20 12:51:25] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: The general Star Wars community is impossible to please
[2021-04-20 12:51:26] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: They weren't needed.
[2021-04-20 12:51:31] (723466293998518292) MiniRebel(Moose)#3182: True that
[2021-04-20 12:51:34] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: No it's totally possible to please.
[2021-04-20 12:51:35] (771298856004223007) Marian_#7941: Abso-fucking-lutely
[2021-04-20 12:51:41] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: The sequels weren't warranted.
[2021-04-20 12:51:48] (723466293998518292) MiniRebel(Moose)#3182: Well everyone is gonna have a different opinions no matter what
[2021-04-20 12:51:53] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: I don’t think I would like just a fan serviced movie
[2021-04-20 12:51:55] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: But there is ***SO MUCH*** stuff before the prequels they could have done, that would have been so amazing.
[2021-04-20 12:52:09] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: And if they did it, everyone would lose their minds and watch it.
[2021-04-20 12:52:38] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Making basically carbon copies of the OG and marketing them as sequels wasn't needed, the story was wrapped up and ended nearly after RotJ.
[2021-04-20 12:52:47] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: Cause the general consensus of Star Wars fans is sexism, and luke being the most powerful person to ever exist which just isn’t true
[2021-04-20 12:52:51] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: But the amount of prequel material to dive into was just insane.
[2021-04-20 12:53:03] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Ah, a lot of people don't read so much of the extended stuff.
[2021-04-20 12:53:18] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It's all confusing and messy, and who is the strongest is amazingly confusing and convoluted and hard to understand.

[2021-04-20 12:55:22] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Some SW fans are definitely sexist, but most of them aren't.... They're just regular people who like Star Wars.
[2021-04-20 12:55:22] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: Damsels in distress you mean :/
[2021-04-20 12:55:34] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Ventress definitely not a damsel of any kind.
[2021-04-20 12:55:35] (723466293998518292) MiniRebel(Moose)#3182: Ashoka one if my favs and U get loads of hate for it

[2021-04-20 12:55:59] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Ahsoka is awesome.
[2021-04-20 12:55:59] (723466293998518292) MiniRebel(Moose)#3182: Ikr!
[2021-04-20 12:56:11] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Most SW fans I know, (and I know many ***many*** fans) don't have a problem with her.
[2021-04-20 12:56:12] (723466293998518292) MiniRebel(Moose)#3182: 2 whites sabres
[2021-04-20 12:56:23] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: They hate the depiction really early in CW because that wasn't good.
[2021-04-20 12:56:28] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: But the character they ended up building is amazing.
[2021-04-20 12:56:34] (723466293998518292) MiniRebel(Moose)#3182: Mine are the people who call CW a kids show
[2021-04-20 12:56:36] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Leia ain't no damsel.
[2021-04-20 12:56:43] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Padmé isn't either.
[2021-04-20 12:56:56] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Mon Mothma kinda does nothing in the films.... but the extended stuff paints her as awesome.
[2021-04-20 12:57:05] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Hera is cool too!
[2021-04-20 12:57:51] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: I say most of the time they are unfortunately
[2021-04-20 12:57:58] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: They never seem to do anything on their own

[2021-04-20 12:58:36] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: Definitely later on Leia is queen shit
[2021-04-20 12:59:37] (771298856004223007) Marian_#7941: the main point for me is the shift from supporting character to protagonist
[2021-04-20 12:59:45] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Leia saved Han, Luke and Chewie on the Death Star, Padmé did loads of sneaky stuff alone in CW, Ahsoka had an awful lot of the very best moments of being cool in Clone Wars. All the ventress stuff after she leaves Dooku is amazing and she's not taking anyone's BS, Mon Mothma is an awesome politician who built the rebellion.
[2021-04-20 12:59:48] (771298856004223007) Marian_#7941: Leia -> Rey

[2021-04-20 13:00:25] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: When she runs the rebellion and what not in the sequels
[2021-04-20 13:00:41] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: She never really.... Does anything in them.

[2021-04-20 13:00:53] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Carrie Fisher wasn't so well so she's not actually got a lot of scenes.
[2021-04-20 13:01:00] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: I know
[2021-04-20 13:01:15] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: I believe there was good stuff planned by JJ for E8 but..... That never happened.
[2021-04-20 13:01:15] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: More of my issue is with people not with the movies
[2021-04-20 13:01:45] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It's a very small minority who are actually that bad.... Most of them are just.... Chill people.

[2021-04-20 13:02:00] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: Very vocal small minority

[2021-04-20 13:02:20] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: They're shouting loud but they don't matter.
[2021-04-20 13:02:24] (771298856004223007) Marian_#7941: you're most definitely underestimating the size of the global alt-right, without wanting to get political

[2021-04-20 13:04:23] (771298856004223007) Marian_#7941: right, not suited for this channel
[2021-04-20 13:05:45] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: But what I will say is, sure there's a vocal minority of complete jerks in the SW community, like every community. But if you go in and like.... Just go to comic con or something, and avoid the really specialist communities and conventions it's just cool people who like a cool sci-fi universe.
[2021-04-20 13:06:08] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: If you go looking around the forums and groups and conventions *specifically* around Star Wars, you run more often into the nasty types.
[2021-04-20 13:06:20] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Honestly though, they're not as good as comic con anyway.
[2021-04-20 13:06:29] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Comic con does everything and it's better organised.
[2021-04-20 13:06:43] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It's just more fun with nicer people.
[2021-04-20 13:07:31] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: And if you ever do find someone who's really mean or annoying or you think is really really silly..... You can always just walk away, go to another stall and decide you want to look at stuff for the MCU until they go away.
[2021-04-20 13:08:06] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Or you can leave and get a snack.

[2021-04-20 13:09:33] (771298856004223007) Marian_#7941: I completely agree, but I would argue that comic con fans are also just a vocal minority themselves. there is a silent majority of fans that just watches the movies and doesnt participate in conversations online or at comic con

[2021-04-20 18:30:43] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Original, boxed kits sell really really well.
[2021-04-20 18:30:54] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Best thing to do is do it as a job lot and sell it by weight.
[2021-04-20 18:31:27] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: If it's like... More than 2 kilos, nobody will actually know how much LEGO that is and they'll go for it more likely than not as long as it doesn't seem too expensive.

[2021-04-20 21:56:22] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: To be honest I love every single one and I think that Hamilton is a masterwork of modern opera.
[2021-04-20 21:56:33] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: modern opera?
[2021-04-20 21:56:43] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: And yes I say opera became musically it's much more like an opera than a Broadway show
[2021-04-20 21:57:03] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: Alright
[2021-04-20 21:57:09] (727459184521510913) McDontle#6037: i kinda agree here, especially at the start
[2021-04-20 21:57:18] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: The structure and the way the music is made
[2021-04-20 21:57:24] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It's just not a musical
[2021-04-20 21:57:25] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: I’m biased bc I don’t like operas so XD
[2021-04-20 21:57:34] (727459184521510913) McDontle#6037: when the dialogue kicks in its a musical, but the first bit where everything is sung is opera
[2021-04-20 21:57:38] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: They just call it that to put bums in seats
[2021-04-20 21:57:47] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Opera has dialogue too
[2021-04-20 21:57:57] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Aww, why not?
[2021-04-20 21:58:06] (727459184521510913) McDontle#6037: only a small amount tho
[2021-04-20 21:58:28] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: So does Hamilton, most of the "dialogue" has a backing track.
[2021-04-20 21:58:39] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: I once tried watching a classical opera in a local theatre, I ended up laughing out during the entire show bc it felt so awkward.
[2021-04-20 21:58:47] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It's not like Grease where it's all dialogue with a few songs.
[2021-04-20 21:59:00] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It's mostly songs with some dialogue.
[2021-04-20 21:59:25] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Local theatres often struggle to do a good show.

[2021-04-20 21:59:48] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Try the national opera society for your country you'll find a massive quality increase.
[2021-04-20 21:59:51] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: I like modern musicals with lots of lyrics and dialogue
[2021-04-20 22:00:01] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Also there's more variety than people think
[2021-04-20 22:00:21] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Gilbert and Sullivan are often credited as making funny light-hearted operas

[2021-04-20 22:03:11] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: A lot of the background material for Warhammer, which is what I really like, is very grimdark.
[2021-04-20 22:03:40] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: I mean grimdark as a phrase literally comes from Warhammer so that's to be expected I guess....
[2021-04-20 22:04:15] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: Never heard of it 🤔
[2021-04-20 22:04:36] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Warhammer or grimdark?

[2021-04-20 22:05:11] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Well Warhammer is a series based off some tabletop miniature games
[2021-04-20 22:05:32] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: And grimdark is a kind of story genre where everything is terrible
[2021-04-20 22:06:06] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Absolutely everything is awful, all leaders are corrupt and there's no hope for humanity left.
[2021-04-20 22:06:37] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: Dystopian, I like it.
[2021-04-20 22:07:24] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: The classic grimdark story is, the heroes go through all their adventures to stop the overwhelming alien invasion, only to be carted away, never to be seen again by the imperial inquisition because they're now heretics for even knowing aliens exist.
[2021-04-20 22:07:50] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: They make books from a publisher they own called "Black Library" and a lot of them are worth a read.
[2021-04-20 22:08:08] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: If you like that thing you'd probably enjoy some of them.

[2021-04-20 22:10:16] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Warhammer 40,000 is the futuristic one.
[2021-04-20 22:10:23] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: And once you start to get in there
[2021-04-20 22:10:47] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Nothing, ***nothing*** gets close to that level of dystopia.

[2021-04-20 22:11:07] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: is there emotional tension?
[2021-04-20 22:11:07] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It is the gold standard of mass scale dystopia
[2021-04-20 22:11:15] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Oh yeah
[2021-04-20 22:11:21] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: One word

[2021-04-20 22:12:55] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: But be careful with this one
[2021-04-20 22:12:58] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: The Horus heresy is like a 50 book series, but there's lots of awesome ones.
[2021-04-20 22:13:06] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: It’s rly rly rly heavy emotionally
[2021-04-20 22:13:22] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Eisenhorn is probably the best of the shorter series to get going withm
[2021-04-20 22:13:27] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It's really really good
[2021-04-20 22:13:48] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Like Timothy Zahn's Thrawn series kind of good
[2021-04-20 22:14:15] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: Does it focus too much on a sci-if?

[2021-04-20 22:14:49] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It's really not sci-fi to be honest
[2021-04-20 22:15:09] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It's set in the future, but pretty much all knowledge of the future tech has been lost
[2021-04-20 22:15:18] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It does

[2021-04-20 22:15:50] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Grimdark is so grim and so dark that to be any good all it can do is look at characters.

[2021-04-21 04:22:34] (375665878743908353) MetalWarBeast#5052: I am feeling bad. But maybe I can overcome it
[2021-04-21 04:22:45] (375665878743908353) MetalWarBeast#5052: I think I need to message someone
[2021-04-21 04:22:50] (375665878743908353) MetalWarBeast#5052: One second
[2021-04-21 04:23:09] (722510980785111092) Trish#1000: It’s always best to let someone know when your not feeling alright
[2021-04-21 04:24:01] (722510980785111092) Trish#1000: I’ve been calm most of the day which is a relief 😅 most days I get triggered by something
[2021-04-21 04:26:48] (375665878743908353) MetalWarBeast#5052: I think that maybe...idk I shouldn’t. I thought about messaging some people I’ve messaged before, but I have changed things. It’s not how it used to be. A few days ago, I made my ex-boyfriend stop messaging me or visiting me. I did that because I knew I was hurting him by implying that we had a future, but I know now that we did not. And the other guy...well he hasn’t messaged me in about a week. So it’s probably best if I don’t succumb to my impulses and just fall asleep
[2021-04-21 04:27:56] (722510980785111092) Trish#1000: I understand what your saying, and yes sometimes it’s best to sleep on some things if you can
[2021-04-21 04:28:29] (722510980785111092) Trish#1000: I find that when I fall asleep after being very mentally not ok, in the morning I have a much better perspective on the matter
[2021-04-21 04:28:45] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: can you move this convo to heavy chat?
[2021-04-21 04:28:52] (722510980785111092) Trish#1000: Sure 🙂
[2021-04-21 04:28:58] (375665878743908353) MetalWarBeast#5052: I will sleep. Unless they message me, I will sleep. I am feeling very tired

[2021-04-21 18:46:05] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: It’s about explaining different disorders within that category

[2021-04-21 18:49:56] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: You could pretty much say we know almost nothing about psychosis. Even the line between psychotic states and something close like dissociation isn't clearly defined.

[2021-04-21 19:02:57] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: There is a theory that cats walk in front of your feet because, even though they get hurt sometimes, we reward the behaviour by giving them attention, and cats *love* attention.

[2021-04-21 19:03:13] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Cats can be trained using 'attention training' rather than using treats.

For anyone that needs it.
[2021-04-22 07:16:47] (430621608877490186) Rodger#0283: Which means Antartica
[2021-04-22 07:17:04] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Calling any of the Antarctic territories part of their country is a bit of a dodgy claim.
[2021-04-22 07:17:23] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Like *technically* they are, but everyone also signed a treaty saying they aren't.
[2021-04-22 07:17:42] (430621608877490186) Rodger#0283: But well we did
[2021-04-22 07:17:57] (430621608877490186) Rodger#0283: And it’s ours
[2021-04-22 07:17:58] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: So they're not really, but to get everyone to sign the treaty to stop people mining and stuff there they basically had to pretend that the claims still count.
[2021-04-22 07:18:46] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: So anyone with a claim before the treaty sticks to the claims system. But anyone else doing stuff there after the treaty totally ignores the claims.
[2021-04-22 07:18:56] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It's really really weird.
[2021-04-22 07:19:05] (430621608877490186) Rodger#0283: That’s true
[2021-04-22 07:19:24] (430621608877490186) Rodger#0283: But hey that’s international treaties for ya
[2021-04-22 07:19:33] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: The geopolitics of the Antarctic is strange.
[2021-04-22 07:19:56] (430621608877490186) Rodger#0283: Definitely
[2021-04-22 07:20:41] (430621608877490186) Rodger#0283: But for the fact I need to say they are apart of the countries

[2021-04-23 20:35:03] (546823194179272715) snow globe and pearl milk tea#9100: So, my friend invited me into a group chat with her other friend. Let's just say that her other friend's name is Dan and hers is Emma. Dan claimed that the Reaper Leviathan (from Subnautica) was his creation, I called him out for it. He left in embarrassment and was sad after he got called out, Emma got mad at me for calling him out. I don't understand. Dan was probably just a acquaintance to her, and I have been friends with her for 5 years. Why did she do this? And HE CLAIMED THAT HE CREATED THE CREATURE. Emma is a great artist and hates when somebody steals her art and claims that her art is theirs. Dan was basically doing that but he's not stealing art!!

[2021-04-24 02:03:08] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: The only stories our family tells of their childhood is disobedience. Including our grandma and great grandma.

[2021-04-24 02:04:02] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Cats are like that. What did it do?
[2021-04-24 02:06:04] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: When we got our current cat she was only a few weeks old, just off the milk. She would go crazy over a laser pointer. We had a hallway that was really narrow and we would shine the laser on one wall, she would jump, then the opposite, and back, and she would hit both rebounds. 90 degree tic-tacs. Jackie Chan doesn't have shit on that.
[2021-04-24 02:07:40] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: My cat was in the living room and I went into my room and shut the door
