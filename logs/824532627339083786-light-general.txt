[2021-04-09 18:03:48] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: and yeah someone was spamming stuff here and pinged everyone, we disabled pings for now
[2021-04-09 18:03:52] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: YESS, I'm so glad I got into it because I love it
[2021-04-09 18:04:03] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: nuuuu
[2021-04-09 18:04:25] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: He did this a lot. I got dangerously close to getting a B last semester because of it.
[2021-04-09 18:04:32] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: Cool cool, I've used php before. I really dislike html and css though. Now that I have someone working under me, I'll just give them any html/css task I might encounter.
[2021-04-09 18:04:42] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: PHP was my first "real" programming language
[2021-04-09 18:04:44] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: agreed, it's annoying
[2021-04-09 18:04:46] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: ayy
[2021-04-09 18:04:48] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: Still use it to this day
[2021-04-09 18:05:34] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: I'm currently writing tests for a php website thingy and doi g paired programming to migrate from php 7.3 to 8 as 7.3 is going into end of life this year
[2021-04-09 18:05:34] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: A memory leak is a pretty serious issue, but at the same time to get 30%, that's kind of too harsh
[2021-04-09 18:06:30] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: Yeah, I know it's serious, but he took off 70% and left a note saying "If this was your job, you'd be fired." which really hurt.
[2021-04-09 18:06:48] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: I think facebook uses PHP heavily, I'm not sure if they do still.
[2021-04-09 18:07:08] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: that seems really harsh
[2021-04-09 18:07:10] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: Lol fun!
[2021-04-09 18:07:23] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: it's *not* your job that's why you're learning lol
[2021-04-09 18:07:37] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: lol
[2021-04-09 18:07:41] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: but yeah, php is fun
[2021-04-09 18:07:47] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: Yeah, he was *really* harsh. Didn't like him one bit.
[2021-04-09 18:08:07] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: I went into this job with no knowledge of php but now I can understand and write tests for it, so it's amazing
[2021-04-09 18:10:09] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: Maybe there's truth to that, but generally speaking, Nah fam, because people run tests before deploying their code to catch mistakes like that. Maybe you'd be retrained or something along those like, your professor is tripping. Lol an engineer at Google messed up a system so bad that ended up costing a few million dollars to the company and he didn't get fired.
[2021-04-09 18:10:51] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: I know right, freaking ridiculous!
[2021-04-09 18:11:24] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: Yeah, I know, he had a habit of making really hyperbolic remarks like that. It also wasn't even that bad of an issue and I would have caught it if I'd maybe had 10 more minutes to work on it.
[2021-04-09 18:11:25] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: Oh that's awesome, maybe you could teach me a few things because I'm an idiot.
[2021-04-09 18:12:11] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: haha, I ain't that good
[2021-04-09 18:12:41] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: I forgot to delete one (1) pointer and apparently that's bad enough to warrant getting a 30% on a lab assignment. Oh well, I still got an A in the class.
[2021-04-09 18:12:57] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: that's so weird that you drop 70%
[2021-04-09 18:13:11] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: yeah that's a bit much
[2021-04-09 18:13:12] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: Ayy you aced up, you smart!! congrats!
[2021-04-09 18:13:15] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: more than a bit lol
[2021-04-09 18:13:46] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Mine just takes off 2% per mistake, which seems reasonable
[2021-04-09 18:13:57] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: I wonder if I have done anything like that (even though I use almost entirely locals)
[2021-04-09 18:15:25] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: Yeah, his manner of grading was all sorts of inconsistent. He'd take off huge points for small mistakes sometimes but ignore big ones other times.
[2021-04-09 18:16:06] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: at least it's over now though, hopefully you don't have to ever take him again
[2021-04-09 18:17:54] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: I won't, the two classes I took with him are the only classes he teaches <a:groovingcat:739934114920005703>
[2021-04-09 18:18:42] (555192022592520214) Wolfsbane Sys(Ram/Rams)#5811: Who pinged??

[2021-04-09 18:19:52] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: Yeah, it was just some run of the mill troll
[2021-04-09 18:23:15] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Oh is that why I had five pings

[2021-04-09 18:30:05] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: no, not at all.
[2021-04-09 18:34:56] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I can ping you if you want /j
[2021-04-09 18:35:13] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: But those weren’t really enjoyable pings
[2021-04-09 18:35:37] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: I was actually asleep when I got pinged and I have notifications off on my phone at night, so I only noticed after waking up
[2021-04-09 18:35:40] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Not quite sure why a troll would ping the mod roles tho not the smartest decision lmao
[2021-04-09 18:35:58] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: That would be implying trolls are smart enough to make smart decisions
[2021-04-09 18:36:01] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: i’ve seen that before like why bother with the mods that makes you caught faster-

[2021-04-11 22:32:13] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Well everything either reflects light giving a colour, or totally absorbed giving black, right?
[2021-04-11 22:32:13] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: ah, forgot that but isn't it black the combp
[2021-04-11 22:32:13] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: andy said it exactly right

[2021-04-11 22:32:50] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: don't know what I don
[2021-04-11 22:32:56] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: don't know

[2021-04-11 22:33:02] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: I still don't understand why the sky is blue though ;3;
[2021-04-11 22:33:14] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: Raise the flag
[2021-04-11 22:33:43] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah so essentially you have roygbiv which are all the spectrums of visible light. an object absorbs these spectrums and then what isn't absorbed is reflect back making things have color. so yeah you're right
[2021-04-11 22:34:11] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: Sky reflects the sea. No?
[2021-04-11 22:34:15] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: nu
[2021-04-11 22:34:33] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: it's like...something to do with how the light from the sun hits the atmosphere
[2021-04-11 22:34:36] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Light is scattered by the atmosphere, but blue light is scattered more and our eyes are more sensitive to blue light so the sky appears blue
[2021-04-11 22:34:38] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: its to do with wavelengths and shit
[2021-04-11 22:34:41] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: and then it bends and scatters
[2021-04-11 22:34:43] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: but I don't get it
[2021-04-11 22:35:01] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: so if we had better eyes the sky would be rainbow?
[2021-04-11 22:35:09] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Maybe
[2021-04-11 22:35:11] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: possibly
[2021-04-11 22:35:14] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: 0-0
[2021-04-11 22:35:17] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Or probably just white
[2021-04-11 22:35:22] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: ooooh
[2021-04-11 22:35:27] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: okay this makes a bit more sense
[2021-04-11 22:35:41] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: And minor note but light never bends.
[2021-04-11 22:35:55] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: no uhhhh refracts? is that the word?
[2021-04-11 22:36:05] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: like when traveling through different mediums the path changes
[2021-04-11 22:36:12] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: there are tons of colors that we can't see as humans because we only have 3 color receptors
[2021-04-11 22:36:41] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: I wish I had more color receptors ;3;
[2021-04-11 22:36:41] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Refraction is when light changes direction when passing between mediums of different density.
[2021-04-11 22:36:54] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: yes that's what I meant by bend
[2021-04-11 22:37:01] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: you can bend light in water
[2021-04-11 22:37:08] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: That's refraction
[2021-04-11 22:37:16] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Straight lines only, no bending m
[2021-04-11 22:37:23] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: mantis shrimp have 16 color receptors. pretty cool.
[2021-04-11 22:37:31] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It is impossible to make light bend as far as we know.

[2021-04-11 22:37:56] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Even black holes can't do it, they have to cheat.
[2021-04-11 22:38:03] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: bend light in a fiber optic cable
[2021-04-11 22:38:11] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Straight lines only
[2021-04-11 22:38:28] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Total internal refraction
[2021-04-11 22:38:38] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: no it bounces back and forth and stuff i think lksdjlakfj bing bing bing like dat
[2021-04-11 22:38:49] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It just appears to bend on a human scale
[2021-04-11 22:39:09] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: But it's actually lots of tiny straight lines changing the angle in steps
[2021-04-11 22:39:13] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: i submit

[2021-04-11 22:39:52] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Photons have no mass so any change in direction is instantaneous because they have no inertia.
[2021-04-11 22:40:07] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: interesting
[2021-04-11 22:40:12] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: I never understood how light acts both as a wave and a particle
[2021-04-11 22:40:24] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: like it go wheee but it also go badonkadonk
[2021-04-11 22:40:30] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It doesn't, it acts as a waveparticle.
[2021-04-11 22:40:43] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It never acts as both at the same time
[2021-04-11 22:40:48] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: One or the other
[2021-04-11 22:41:00] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: But you cannot know which it will act as until observed
[2021-04-11 22:41:00] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: that....confuses me more
[2021-04-11 22:41:09] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: And the whole idea of a waveparticle is just a model
[2021-04-11 22:41:13] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It works as light

[2021-04-11 22:41:41] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: isn't that when they pew pewed the lazer thing through two slits in foil? when watched it went through 1 but ignored it went through 2
[2021-04-11 22:41:49] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: ljkfdaljksafdjlk always keysmash
[2021-04-11 22:41:52] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Thinking of it as a wave in one scenario and a particle in another is just useful depending on what kind of maths you are wanting to do.
[2021-04-11 22:42:04] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: oh
[2021-04-11 22:42:06] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: maths
[2021-04-11 22:42:43] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: So if you're modelling the photoelectric effect, it's best to model it as particles because the energy packets are in discrete units.
[2021-04-11 22:43:17] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: But if you're doing the double slit interference experiment you need to model it as a wave because particles can't actually interfere like that
[2021-04-11 22:43:33] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: now sheldon...
[2021-04-11 22:43:56] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It's just whichever model is most useful at the time
[2021-04-11 22:44:06] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: And it's also a school thing too
[2021-04-11 22:44:44] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: The real modern model that's currently in use at the cutting edge of quantum physics is weird and confusing and needs like.... 8 PhD's to understand
[2021-04-11 22:44:48] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: I must have been at recess

[2021-04-11 22:45:19] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: The secret is nobody understands it really 🤣
[2021-04-11 22:45:22] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: I just remember the basic experiments and not why XD
[2021-04-11 22:45:25] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I don’t remember any physics, I haven’t taken it in four years

[2021-04-11 22:45:47] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Like we can explain some stuff but we're still not sure where a third of the matter in the universe is
[2021-04-11 22:46:09] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: what's the name of the...bohrs?

[2021-04-11 22:46:26] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: that
[2021-04-11 22:46:46] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: He's a scientist who did a lot of early work in quantum physics.
[2021-04-11 22:46:56] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: yes, he has a particle named after him
[2021-04-11 22:46:58] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Had a big argument with Einstein about the uncertainty principle.
[2021-04-11 22:47:00] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: or a molecule?
[2021-04-11 22:47:14] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: is was it a theory...
[2021-04-11 22:47:22] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: he's also famous for his model of the atom
[2021-04-11 22:47:42] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: maybe I'm thinking of someone else, I can't remember
[2021-04-11 22:48:06] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: The Bohr-Rutherford model.
[2021-04-11 22:48:06] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: ohhh do you mean heisenberg?
[2021-04-11 22:48:40] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Bohrium is named after him, the element.
[2021-04-11 22:48:46] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: it like holds quarks together
[2021-04-11 22:48:48] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: cause he's famous for the heisenberg uncertainty principle

[2021-04-11 22:49:36] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: it...might be?
[2021-04-11 22:49:43] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: It's derivative work on Einsteins theory of relativity
[2021-04-11 22:50:03] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It kind of is but then it also kind of isn't
[2021-04-11 22:50:26] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Like it uses lots of relativity for the mathematics proof

[2021-04-11 22:50:43] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: But the theory itself differs violently from what Einstein thought was true.

[2021-04-11 22:51:45] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It's probably boson. The exchange particle of the strong and weak nuclear force which hold quarks and nucleons together.
[2021-04-11 22:52:07] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: what is the theorem
[2021-04-11 22:52:31] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: The big argument about all the quantum stuff with regard to Einstein is....
[2021-04-11 22:52:41] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Einstein didn't like the uncertainty principle.
[2021-04-11 22:52:54] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Like..... Really *really* didn't like it.
[2021-04-11 22:53:11] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: yesssssssssssss that
[2021-04-11 22:53:11] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It did not sit well with him and he fought against it very strongly.
[2021-04-11 22:53:39] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Most famously against Bohr at the Solvay conference.
[2021-04-11 22:54:46] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Turns out that the uncertainty principle is 100% totally correct though.
[2021-04-11 22:54:56] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Well we think it probably is anyway
[2021-04-11 22:54:59] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: .....ironically
[2021-04-11 22:55:38] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: The famous example of the uncertainty principle is electron position and velocity
[2021-04-11 22:56:15] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: The more information you have about the position of an electron around a nucleus, the less you must know about its velocity
[2021-04-11 22:57:06] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Another famous example of uncertainty is Schrödinger's cat but that's more about superposition so it's not super relevant here.
[2021-04-11 22:58:02] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Also most people don't actually get the point or the key details of that cat right so sometimes people think they know but they don't really.
[2021-04-11 22:58:52] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: We're nosediving into the weird bits of physics I can't explain much longer 🤣

[2021-04-12 03:59:26] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Since you want to bring private work public I might as well start by telling you and the viewers you want the real story here. You got muted for posting inappropriate things in light general and earning 5 strikes to do so, then I dragged you in a private chat today to talk about how the first thing you said when you were unmuted is that the mods have “||daddy issues||” and you were being extremely disrespectful in <#750376381019586651> to talk about your behavior which truly seemed like you do not care at all to be here and shrugged off the fact that after 5 strikes the first thing you did on your unmuted return is to disrespect mods that work very hard to keep this place self. You broke the rules, got dealt your punishment, that you think is unfair (which it was)and now you’re here again to do what exactly ? You wanna be here that’s fine but act appropriate and follow the rules. the fact that In less than 48 hours you accumulated 6+ strikes and a chance you blew to redeem your self in a private mod ticket seems to me like you don’t give a shit about here so if you want to be here kindly prove it

[2021-04-12 09:58:46] (726689449995534387) The Flaming Phoenix#2474: it doesnt have to be big or anything. maybe you're really good at rping and you're proud of it

[2021-04-12 09:59:21] (726689449995534387) The Flaming Phoenix#2474: you're complex enough of a person that it is virtually impossible not to like anything about yourself
[2021-04-12 09:59:38] (829153199624552529) zoey.colette#3638: um its possible
[2021-04-12 10:00:38] (726689449995534387) The Flaming Phoenix#2474: alright. try this: if you think you can't like yourself, that means you're aware of your flaws
[2021-04-12 10:00:45] (726689449995534387) The Flaming Phoenix#2474: that's something to be proud of
[2021-04-12 10:00:54] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: My mom was down and we talked about Grandma, her mother. Mom liked that. She didn't have a talk about grandma in a long time

[2021-04-12 10:04:46] (726689449995534387) The Flaming Phoenix#2474: you know there are parts of you that are not good, and that means you have a really good idea of who you are as a person
[2021-04-12 10:04:58] (726689449995534387) The Flaming Phoenix#2474: that's not something a lot of people can realise
[2021-04-12 10:05:11] (829153199624552529) zoey.colette#3638: also understood

[2021-04-12 10:07:38] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: I think I'm a fun conversationalist but I can go for days without speaking to anyone
[2021-04-12 10:07:52] (726689449995534387) The Flaming Phoenix#2474: yes, like that
[2021-04-12 10:08:28] (726689449995534387) The Flaming Phoenix#2474: i tend to be judgemental and have high standards, but have a strong enough sense of self to know when im being judgemental
[2021-04-12 10:08:48] (829153199624552529) zoey.colette#3638: understood

[2021-04-12 10:13:48] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: Usually when that happens to me I have realized I had been carrying around that anger for years, not days

Some languages don't have any words for specific colours, and others draw the divisions at different points. The language you learn the colours of the rainbow in effects your perceptions of colour.

[2021-04-12 22:12:02] (799410612333182996) TheFrostQueen❄#7887: Nope. I do that sometimes. They are from you’re creation/mind after all
[2021-04-12 22:13:10] (651068724304019506) SM_Dark#5993: but if you like, made a unique device or smth, would that be considered as ur 'child'
[2021-04-12 22:13:36] (799410612333182996) TheFrostQueen❄#7887: Oh you mean like technology?
[2021-04-12 22:15:59] (799410612333182996) TheFrostQueen❄#7887: It’s you’re brain child (I think that’s how the saying goes) so it’s not weird to refer to it that way

[2021-04-12 22:17:58] (651068724304019506) SM_Dark#5993: yea but they r living things too
[2021-04-12 22:22:30] (829153199624552529) zoey.colette#3638: When people with pets take the title of “parent” and blur the line between pets and children, our language is distorted in a way that only adds to our confusion and anxiety. It may be a gentle delusion to think of your pet as your “child,” but it’s still a delusion. Misnaming our relationship with pets isn’t just a lighthearted goof.

[2021-04-12 22:31:28] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: 1. it's allows us to know what pronouns to address you by
2. it can show what disorders you have (ofc only if you're comfortable sharing)
3. it allows you to join certain ping-able groups, for example support
4. it can help display what general timezone you're in
5. it can give you access to certain channels

[2021-04-13 15:17:22] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: I see people with like 400

[2021-04-13 15:22:53] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: i dont understand how people can handle that many pings personally, hearing like- five in a row scares me

[2021-04-13 15:32:26] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: But nothing seems to be working as well anymore
[2021-04-13 15:32:57] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: I wanna see my counsellor again but it’s currently hard to do so
[2021-04-13 15:32:59] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: sometimes it can feel that way, im not entirely sure what it is myself but i believe youre just perhaps getting used to the feel if that makes sense?
[2021-04-13 15:33:10] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: ohh i get that, corona hits hard at the moment
[2021-04-13 15:33:18] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: I thought I’ve been fine for a year or two now
[2021-04-13 15:33:36] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: But I kinda had the realization that I’m sad all the time. And it’s become the new normal again
[2021-04-13 15:34:07] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: well before you felt sad all the time, what was the difference?
[2021-04-13 15:34:29] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: maybe it was a sort of change that you havent considered yet, ive had moments like those
[2021-04-13 15:34:33] (124971768627724288) Jackie, The Vibe Walker#1068: I don’t remember that’s the kicker

I was being hunted by men and the old man got some smugglers that would bring me out libia and to Britian. So after going on the boat and going to Britian we got attacked by the men seeking for me. Long story short I joined the military to fight back these men and my father was one of the attackers and cut off my hand during one of the attacks. Im just thankful for being alive and even with my ptsd.

[2021-04-14 02:33:07] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: I once locked myself in a cage with a dog
[2021-04-14 02:33:18] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: The dog was very tini and fluffy
[2021-04-14 02:33:23] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: And I was 4

[2021-04-14 02:34:02] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: im personally a sucker for corners and small spaces, i usually feel safest there
[2021-04-14 02:34:47] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: dark corners with a blanket ar safe
[2021-04-14 02:34:53] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: exactly
[2021-04-14 02:34:58] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Adahabaha
[2021-04-14 02:35:27] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: man that sounds really nice right now but i need my music atm to distract myself
[2021-04-14 02:35:40] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: bright makes me uncomfy
and when i'm in an open space hiding is hard
~~basically normal houses feel unsafe~~
[2021-04-14 02:35:47] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: I have reddit videos in the background
[2021-04-14 02:36:15] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: I feel unsafe because my house has giant windows, and 2 are next to my bed.
[2021-04-14 02:36:23] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: i get that, sometimes i flip flop with lighting, depends on whos around me i think? that i dont understand quite yet
[2021-04-14 02:36:39] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: ours is all first floor and mom insists we have the windows open until it's super dark
[2021-04-14 02:36:58] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: and the windows fill almost the entire wall
[2021-04-14 02:37:10] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: oh that would make me uneasy,, my parents are paranoid and cover all the windows
[2021-04-14 02:37:28] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: sadly their paranioa traveled to me
[2021-04-14 02:37:35] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Hence I have dog
[2021-04-14 02:37:36] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: yeah if i have my room's door open or windows open we feel pretty unsafe
[2021-04-14 02:37:46] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Dog makes me feel safe
[2021-04-14 02:38:07] (766014315228168244) Seaweedsplat#4734: Why did my tablet disconnect from the internet for a bit aaa
[2021-04-14 02:38:13] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: i cannot have my door open, that makes me uneasy and ive got animals in my room that.. cant exactly leave
[2021-04-14 02:38:40] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: my cats are too small and i live in the woods, if they get loose id probably never see them again
[2021-04-14 02:38:43] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: every time parents walk by they tell us to leave it open
[2021-04-14 02:38:44] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Only my dog allowed in my room at night, cat eats my bed.
[2021-04-14 02:38:56] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: **cats eat beds??**
[2021-04-14 02:39:05] (766014315228168244) Seaweedsplat#4734: I always want to close my door but that leaves me fearing my parents busting in with no warning to do something so yeah
[2021-04-14 02:39:09] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: we're waiting for the day an alter comes and yells at them
[2021-04-14 02:39:21] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Here I'll post a photo <#714573685431730207>
[2021-04-14 02:39:41] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: speaking of cats, ones just crushing my keybaord
[2021-04-14 02:39:51] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: There we go

[2021-04-14 02:40:19] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: *fuck me...*
*the clipboard noise is back*
*help*
[2021-04-14 02:40:22] (766014315228168244) Seaweedsplat#4734: usually just like I want my door closed but I don’t want to be alone but somebody else in my room drives me up the wall because *dude that’s my stuff*
[2021-04-14 02:40:24] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: mine usually likes to eat tape, i dont hang things on my wall
[2021-04-14 02:40:32] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: ?_?
[2021-04-14 02:40:47] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: whats bad about it? do you wanna share?
[2021-04-14 02:41:07] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: idk

or walking
etc

Yeap I'm with you there
[2021-04-14 02:41:31] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: hmm.. you can try humming to yourself
[2021-04-14 02:41:55] (766014315228168244) Seaweedsplat#4734: <:HeartGivingPengu:798783648086229022>
[2021-04-14 02:41:58] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: I got voices, and incoherent whispering
[2021-04-14 02:42:03] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: same here
[2021-04-14 02:42:18] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Sounds like someone's psspspspsps in my ear
[2021-04-14 02:42:26] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: once in awhile ill hear some.. odd screaming of my name but it feels so faint? its hard to explain
[2021-04-14 02:43:16] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: one time i swore i heard the tv play fireflies but when i checked it out, nothing was on
[2021-04-14 02:43:46] (766014315228168244) Seaweedsplat#4734: I don’t get that, I usually find real things to jump at (such as somebody being in the hallway or the sounds of *those shows* that I don’t like)
[2021-04-14 02:44:06] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: valid,
[2021-04-14 02:44:20] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: I see animals and people too, one time I thought there was dog in The road and nearly went off the road.
[2021-04-14 02:44:30] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: That- 
Hasn't happened since...
[2021-04-14 02:44:32] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: ill have moments like that where i just randomly jump because someone was in the hallway
[2021-04-14 02:44:58] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: and i hope it doesnt happen again for your sake, its a weird thing to happen and can make you antsy
[2021-04-14 02:45:11] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: sounds like someone saying "hey kid, hey, hey, hey kid"
repeatedly over and over
then when i finally acknowledge it it just says i'm a failure or smth and goes back to the hey kid
[2021-04-14 02:45:23] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Yeah, now it's usually people, like walking from their houses. Then they suddenly vanish.
[2021-04-14 02:45:50] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: thats odd,,
[2021-04-14 02:45:56] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: well- both are odd
[2021-04-14 02:46:07] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: and i know it's not an alter
[2021-04-14 02:46:14] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: My voices tend to fit the scene I'm in, and I answe them, and people look at me like I'm nuts.
[2021-04-14 02:46:19] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: i recall seeing some sort of- white figure crawl on my ceiling and go into the bathroom
[2021-04-14 02:46:33] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: same thing disappeared under my bed once
[2021-04-14 02:46:45] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Again, I wanted to talk about this earlier before work now I am
[2021-04-14 02:46:51] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: T wT
[2021-04-14 02:46:51] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: i never leave the house so that's the only one i really hear
sometimes they'll do some other stuff too
commenting on things
[2021-04-14 02:47:21] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: none of them are other alters
[2021-04-14 02:47:40] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: so idk at this point
[2021-04-14 02:48:00] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: These realistic voices have been around for 2-3 days now?...
[2021-04-14 02:48:02] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: maybe its a memory toying with you? im not exactly sure
[2021-04-14 02:48:09] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: They're getting the better of me to say the least
[2021-04-14 02:48:23] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: thats good
[2021-04-14 02:48:26] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: we dont have any memories of any of the stuff like that though so
[2021-04-14 02:48:40] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: ?????
[2021-04-14 02:49:01] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: oh did i misunderstand- i took it as a way that the voices are fading away
[2021-04-14 02:49:07] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Oop
[2021-04-14 02:49:17] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: That okay
[2021-04-14 02:49:27] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: i hope so,, sorry for the misunderstanding
[2021-04-14 02:49:34] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: It good
[2021-04-14 02:49:53] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: I got a therapy app tmrw.
[2021-04-14 02:50:03] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Hoping ican speak up
[2021-04-14 02:50:03] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: oohh! i hope it goes well
[2021-04-14 02:50:12] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: I'll also see people who I know aren't there when I'm out and about taking notes then glancing at me taking notes repeat
[2021-04-14 02:50:18] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: youve got this friend!
[2021-04-14 02:50:57] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: its odd how your mind can toy with you,, do you have any ideas on why they maybe showing up?
[2021-04-14 02:50:58] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Oh oh!!! I was taking the psat at my school, and I kept seeing this lady out the corner of Mt eye just WATCJING me take the test.
[2021-04-14 02:51:07] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: eh no idea
[2021-04-14 02:51:51] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: She didn't exist either
[2021-04-14 02:52:06] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: sadly seeing and hearing things arent things i have a specialty to deal with, so im trying to figure out random little things and link them together
[2021-04-14 02:52:22] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Yea
[2021-04-14 02:52:33] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Brain whu

[2021-04-14 02:53:50] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: Mine will be there and act like normal people, usually they'll disappear into a building after a bit
[2021-04-14 02:54:27] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Mine go away after a few mins, and then my brain hurts cause I thought it was real
[2021-04-14 02:54:43] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Like, my classmate wasn't at school that day, they sit next to me
[2021-04-14 02:54:54] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: And a hallucination filled the seat
[2021-04-14 02:55:06] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: It took me half the class period to realize
[2021-04-14 02:55:20] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: No one was there
[2021-04-14 02:55:44] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: But now we virtual and I gotta deal with random in my room corner

an in depth game like Mafia or murder mystery, I had an idea with my friends a while ago with tons of details.

Or, a game that explores mental health through the eyes of different characters. The game would carry you through the lives of tons of characters, in a 2d story like an interactive visual novel.

[2021-04-14 14:13:55] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Really depends on where you live. Spanish is useless in Canada, but French is one of our primary langauges.
