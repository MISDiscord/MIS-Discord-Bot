One time, I did the assignment completely correctly, but got a 30% because I forgot to fix a memory leak.
[2021-04-09 18:03:46] (429149430671736833) ᴸ ᴸᵃʷˡⁱᵉᵗ#8213: Gotcha, thanks for letting me know lol
[2021-04-09 18:03:48] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: and yeah someone was spamming stuff here and pinged everyone, we disabled pings for now
[2021-04-09 18:03:52] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: YESS, I'm so glad I got into it because I love it
[2021-04-09 18:04:03] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: nuuuu
[2021-04-09 18:04:25] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: He did this a lot. I got dangerously close to getting a B last semester because of it.
[2021-04-09 18:04:32] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: Cool cool, I've used php before. I really dislike html and css though. Now that I have someone working under me, I'll just give them any html/css task I might encounter.
[2021-04-09 18:04:42] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: PHP was my first "real" programming language
[2021-04-09 18:04:44] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: agreed, it's annoying
[2021-04-09 18:04:46] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: ayy
[2021-04-09 18:04:48] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: Still use it to this day
[2021-04-09 18:05:34] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: I'm currently writing tests for a php website thingy and doi g paired programming to migrate from php 7.3 to 8 as 7.3 is going into end of life this year
[2021-04-09 18:05:34] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: A memory leak is a pretty serious issue, but at the same time to get 30%, that's kind of too harsh
[2021-04-09 18:06:30] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: Yeah, I know it's serious, but he took off 70% and left a note saying "If this was your job, you'd be fired." which really hurt.
[2021-04-09 18:06:48] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: I think facebook uses PHP heavily, I'm not sure if they do still.
[2021-04-09 18:07:08] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: that seems really harsh
[2021-04-09 18:07:10] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: Lol fun!
[2021-04-09 18:07:23] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: it's *not* your job that's why you're learning lol
[2021-04-09 18:07:37] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: lol
[2021-04-09 18:07:41] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: but yeah, php is fun
[2021-04-09 18:07:47] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: Yeah, he was *really* harsh. Didn't like him one bit.
[2021-04-09 18:08:07] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: I went into this job with no knowledge of php but now I can understand and write tests for it, so it's amazing
[2021-04-09 18:10:09] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: Maybe there's truth to that, but generally speaking, Nah fam, because people run tests before deploying their code to catch mistakes like that. Maybe you'd be retrained or something along those like, your professor is tripping. Lol an engineer at Google messed up a system so bad that ended up costing a few million dollars to the company and he didn't get fired.
[2021-04-09 18:10:51] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: I know right, freaking ridiculous!
[2021-04-09 18:11:24] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: Yeah, I know, he had a habit of making really hyperbolic remarks like that. It also wasn't even that bad of an issue and I would have caught it if I'd maybe had 10 more minutes to work on it.
[2021-04-09 18:11:25] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: Oh that's awesome, maybe you could teach me a few things because I'm an idiot.
[2021-04-09 18:12:11] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: haha, I ain't that good
[2021-04-09 18:12:41] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: I forgot to delete one (1) pointer and apparently that's bad enough to warrant getting a 30% on a lab assignment. Oh well, I still got an A in the class.
[2021-04-09 18:12:57] (386922883231907841) Fallen Angel#4892: that's so weird that you drop 70%
[2021-04-09 18:13:11] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: yeah that's a bit much
[2021-04-09 18:13:12] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: Ayy you aced up, you smart!! congrats!
[2021-04-09 18:13:15] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: more than a bit lol
[2021-04-09 18:13:46] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Mine just takes off 2% per mistake, which seems reasonable
[2021-04-09 18:13:57] (681531347583631444) Vortetty#5020: I wonder if I have done anything like that (even though I use almost entirely locals)
[2021-04-09 18:15:25] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: Yeah, his manner of grading was all sorts of inconsistent. He'd take off huge points for small mistakes sometimes but ignore big ones other times.
[2021-04-09 18:16:06] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: at least it's over now though, hopefully you don't have to ever take him again
[2021-04-09 18:17:54] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: I won't, the two classes I took with him are the only classes he teaches <a:groovingcat:739934114920005703>
[2021-04-09 18:18:42] (555192022592520214) Wolfsbane Sys(Ram/Rams)#5811: Who pinged??

[2021-04-09 18:19:52] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: Yeah, it was just some run of the mill troll
[2021-04-09 18:23:15] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Oh is that why I had five pings

[2021-04-09 18:30:05] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: no, not at all.
[2021-04-09 18:34:56] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I can ping you if you want /j
[2021-04-09 18:35:13] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: But those weren’t really enjoyable pings
[2021-04-09 18:35:37] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: I was actually asleep when I got pinged and I have notifications off on my phone at night, so I only noticed after waking up
[2021-04-09 18:35:40] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Not quite sure why a troll would ping the mod roles tho not the smartest decision lmao
[2021-04-09 18:35:58] (213497002548396032) Alchemy#0001: That would be implying trolls are smart enough to make smart decisions
[2021-04-09 18:36:01] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: i’ve seen that before like why bother with the mods that makes you caught faster-
