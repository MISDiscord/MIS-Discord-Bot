As you already probably saw, there was a warning given on your action of saying ||n word|| in <#820020822487728188> of the day and I just wanted to know if you can give us a better understanding of what you meant and why you put it there if you kindly would. I’d also obviously ask you review our rules and such and understand why we were concerned to see even the mention of it uncensored that isn’t for the reason of “hey someone called me this” or something along those lines. We just want to make sure we’re all on the same page and can move forward and you understand why it was issued a warn and that it won’t be acceptable for next time
