i dont have triggers like its rare i get triggered and if i get triggered i write about them in my journal
[2021-04-12 19:04:27] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: ok cool. i'm going to run a simulation with you of how a ticket would go.
[2021-04-12 19:06:32] (816290883867639849) kimjvoir#0950: okay:)
[2021-04-12 19:08:59] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: hi. i've been dealing with a lot lately. i recently went through a breakup and i can't stop blaming myself for the way it ended. i feel like he never cared about me and that it's all my fault.
[2021-04-12 19:11:05] (816290883867639849) kimjvoir#0950: if he never cared about u its definitely not your fault its his fault for not caring he obviously doesn’t deserve you or your love and sooner or later he will realize what he lost and will regret so bad its not your fault trust me he is such an asshole for it and if it helps u can write about ur feelings in a paper and then burn it it helps :))
[2021-04-12 19:12:28] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: but he's the only person whose ever loved me. it has to be my fault that he's gone. i'm such a terrible person. i messed up so many times during that relationship.
[2021-04-12 19:14:25] (816290883867639849) kimjvoir#0950: no what u feel right now was results from his gaslighting he made u feel like its all ur fault but its not the situation and even if u messed up during the relationship this is part of a relationship, true relationships goes ups and downs they all argue and its fine and they fix it together they communicate, so what u had was definitely a toxic one and he lacked his communication w u
[2021-04-12 19:16:08] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah but i should have been there for him. i should have noticed that he was getting depressed and did something to help. he hurt himself because i didn't help him.
[2021-04-12 19:18:24] (816290883867639849) kimjvoir#0950: it’s not your mistake , in relationships first step is trust and he should have told you but when he didn’t obviously didn’t trust which also has signs it was a pretty toxic relationship and if he hurt himself because “u” didnt help him that is pure manipulating he could have told u , u cant helping everyone sometimes its ok not to be able its not your job to fix them or anything
[2021-04-12 19:19:16] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah but i feel like no one will ever love me now. my parents don't even love me. maybe i'm just cursed to be unloveable. i just don't understand why i even continue when i know no one will ever care.
[2021-04-12 19:21:11] (816290883867639849) kimjvoir#0950: nope i disagree with u i was there i thought nobody will love me i wont turn it into my experience but what i wanna tell u is there will be one day you will meet someone who is not toxic he will accept he will trust u he is willing to communicate and not one sided one u r loved and cared about , if ur parents dont love u then they suck ass i care about u
[2021-04-12 19:25:37] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: but how can you say that if you don't know the future?
[2021-04-12 19:27:23] (816290883867639849) kimjvoir#0950: i definitely don’t know the future but i know it will happen u will find happiness maybe it wont seem like that now but it will happen
[2021-04-12 19:28:50] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: thank you. i just don't know how to move on from him.
[2021-04-12 19:29:50] (816290883867639849) kimjvoir#0950: moving from someone is pretty hard especially if u loved him but u can do stuff u like to forgot abt him and write about ur feelings and self care is imp and it will slowly happen
[2021-04-12 19:30:41] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: thank you. i'll try that.
[2021-04-12 19:31:09] (816290883867639849) kimjvoir#0950: anytime i hope u will feel better
