[2021-04-21 03:44:45] (449466856550694913) Sidryza#6023: hii! i would really like support with neurodivergent stuff cause i really am not sure if i am and how to bring it up to my psychiatrist
[2021-04-21 03:45:14] (449466856550694913) Sidryza#6023: because i have a limited time with her everytime i see her, so i want to manage my time and tell her everything i need to in that time yknow?
[2021-04-21 03:45:43] (449466856550694913) Sidryza#6023: and i'm unsure if i should even talk to her about it at all or if its cause for concern in any way
[2021-04-21 03:46:18] (449466856550694913) Sidryza#6023: so i'd like someone to talk to about this who won't judge me for 'not having strong enough symptoms' like what happens with my current friend group
[2021-04-21 03:46:42] (449466856550694913) Sidryza#6023: i think currently my biggest trigger is being invalidated in some way
[2021-04-21 03:47:28] (449466856550694913) Sidryza#6023: i'm very sensitive to rejection HAHA
[2021-04-21 03:47:33] (449466856550694913) Sidryza#6023: which i hate
[2021-04-21 03:48:51] (449466856550694913) Sidryza#6023: once someone invalidated me and i couldnt leave bed for two days and i wish i could handle criticism better
[2021-04-21 03:49:02] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Well it’s safe to to that your feelings and emotions in this ticket and across this server will be validated.

I just want to make sure iim clear before I continue I won’t give you like any diagnosis or anything like that regarding if you have “strong enough systems” but I will gladly listen to everything you have to say and point you in the right direction and comfort you in a way that you know what you’re feeling is 1000% valid
[2021-04-21 03:49:39] (449466856550694913) Sidryza#6023: i'm not here for a diagnosis at all promise!!
[2021-04-21 03:49:50] (449466856550694913) Sidryza#6023: i just would like to talk to someone about it to better understand myself
[2021-04-21 03:50:03] (449466856550694913) Sidryza#6023: because if i keep it in my brain, it's hard to remember every single symptom
[2021-04-21 03:50:12] (449466856550694913) Sidryza#6023: but by talking to someone and writing it down, it helps a lot
[2021-04-21 03:50:35] (449466856550694913) Sidryza#6023: but this will help me get a diagnosis by making my symptoms more clear to me you know?
[2021-04-21 03:51:22] (449466856550694913) Sidryza#6023: since im talking to a professional and that costs money id like to make my visits mean a lot and have lots of progress
[2021-04-21 03:52:12] (449466856550694913) Sidryza#6023: this means so much to me by the way hahah im happy that people want to help

[2021-04-21 03:55:15] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: It makes me happy to know that I can help and make others feel comfortable with their problems that they may be too shy to say to others. It’s sometimes good to have someone like completely unbiased doesn’t know you just listen and actual care about the other and try to help and support them
[2021-04-21 03:55:27] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: And that’s why I’m here! <:maywow:756208908942573730> <:CuteHap:753811556793581608>  so by all means go on I’m here
