[2021-04-10 20:29:17] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: Hey <@&705596937201516544>, in just 1.5 hours we will be watching Ratatouille. Feel free to join whenever you can (but a movie is always better if you watch from the start!) There's just a couple things I need to address:

1) As always server rules still apply
2) During the movie I ask you to have your mic muted so that the movie isn't interrupted
3) Use <#704860630368387072> for any discussion during the movie but please refrain from saying any spoilers

If you haven't joined a team yet please do so by going to the message in the pins of this channel and react to that. This is so you can earn your participation points and maybe your team will win <@&825463118117208084>! 

Enjoy tonight's movie night!
