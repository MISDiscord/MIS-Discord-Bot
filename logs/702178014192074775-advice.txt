[2021-04-09 08:21:38] (768389205893578752) bloodovicha#3320: TW: social anxiety, mention of depression

Hi, I feel like an idiot. I have ||social anxiety and depression|| for reference. My social anxiety has been interfering with my life so much recently. I have a best friend, he's literally my everything. But whenever he doesn't respond I think he doesn't care about me or want to talk to me, when I know he's very busy usually. Yes, he tends to ghost people a lot, but thats for his own reasons and I shouldnt let that ruin my day, and even trigger me. I need help, but since I'm not 18 I can't ask for meds or anything. I don't know what to do. Am i too attatched? Is there a way I can aask for therapy/meds without my parents knowing (USA)?

[2021-04-09 15:19:04] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: I'm no expert, but when I get in a situation like that, I try and keep my mind aware of my breathing and keep it in check (regular and slow breaths). If I realize I'm getting worked up, my breathing tells me and I consciously try and slow it down and take deeper breaths. Might help with acute ||anxiety|| in some situations, plus nobody has to know you're doing it!

[2021-04-09 18:43:25] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Honestly, this kind of thing happens *all the time* but we only notice it when it happens to us, so it can seem like a huge disruption when it's really just a regular aspect of business and employment. The accepted, proper response by your co-workers should be congratulations and/or encouragement. Anyone who might respond negatively is acting 
inappropriately, in most cases. My advice would be to accept any kind words or praise that comes your way, because odds are you totally deserve it and are just being a bit tough on yourself! (aren't we all, sometimes?)

Nothing makes anyone better than loving themselves - I know you may not feel like it, but try and do something that is kind to yourself - make yourself some good soul food, and  curl up in front of netflix; or go for a walk and enjoy the sunshine... It doesn't make it go away, but small things like that give us the releases of dopamine and endorphins that can pick us up slightly. For me, I have found running great - the hardest part is getting out of bed, but that's exactly it - once your out you are one step closer to doing somethinng to make you feel better. You've got this dude!

Typically what you can look for is your first dose you will feel fine. Your body is first learning about how to fight off the spike proteins. The second dose you might feel a little off, but in all of the data I have found most people just feel a little off for one day and then are fully back to normal! Of course this has the possibility of being different, as everyone is unique. I am getting the ||Pfizer|| in 2 days. I can let you know how it goes!
[2021-04-12 13:07:50] (421837462047031297) Dkal#4012: Also to give a bit of reassurance. Both of my elderly grandparents have been ||vaccinated|| and are completely fine! For someone in their late 20s early 30s, I am confident you will be fine! (Note: I am not a medical professional, although I am referencing data and stories from people in the field. If you are concerned about it you should contact your primary care provider! )

[2021-04-12 13:26:35] (421837462047031297) Dkal#4012: In my personal and family's experience with ||vaccination||, typically you feel fine the first dose, and you feel a little off the second dose. Other than that there are no major side effects! Of course it is different for every person. If you are worried I would recommend you talk to your primary care provider for medical advice.
[2021-04-12 20:42:32] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Okay so, don't wanna bother anybody, but I sort of want advice in terms of disability and asking for assistance. I do believe that my GAD is a struggle for me on a daily basis as of now, and being overwhelmed really sets me back in some assignments, along with unhealthy habits. However, in the US where I live, you have to have paperwork from a psychiatrist or someone with a Dr. title to "prove" you have your disorder(s), but I only have docs from my therapist. Would it be worth making an appointment to get updated documents?
[2021-04-12 20:45:16] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Also, for context, I have accommodations for my physical disability but it just doesn't cover the full scope of issues I have
[2021-04-12 20:53:19] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: You are not bothering anyone üôÇ 
I live in the US and I agree that having a Dr. (or Psy NP under the supervision of a Dr.)  officially document any conditions in question is only going to help you get care more easily and sooner. I'm no expert, but I can see how it would totally be worth the time and effort getting things fully-documented.
[2021-04-12 20:55:58] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Alright, thank you, I *really* appreciate the help. Everyone within my "support" team has advised that I do *not* seek extra help, even when organizations have offered them to me, as they told me that as I get better I will not need the help... but I still think it would make sense, even if it is a long and confusing process to find said Drs. Thank you!
[2021-04-12 21:02:17] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Better to have it in place and not need it! Sounds kind of odd to tell someone not to get help, but I cannot speak for those individuals and I'm not a psych professional, granted.
[2021-04-12 21:14:01] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Thanks for your input, I think that makes sense! And yeah it's strange all around, even to some organizations as I said lol.

[2021-04-13 02:19:29] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: How do you build a support system with individuals who are unable to comprehend how you feel? I am generally the encourager in the majority of my friend groups but I am usually unable to be open about my struggles because it is met with judgment, inability to comprehend/respond, or nothing at all. I have a hard time distinguishing whether support is a want or a need, but I think that when I am really struggling it is more of a need. I just downplay it. I seldomly express a need for support because I want to be a strong rock for people, which I think is why I feel it is major when I do express the need, and when that verbalized need goes unnoticed my brain registers that as devastating rejection. My dilemma is knowing you must communicate a need for people to know and support you but not wishing to verbalize them and be met with painful silence in addition to not knowing how to establish a support system in friend groups.  Any suggestions for a starting point?

However, they tend to be naive, only recognizing some people's needs while excluding the recognition of others, such as myself.  I think this is ultimately because some repetitively and emphatically express a need whereas others like myself only express a need when things are severe, if at all.
[2021-04-13 02:33:36] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i understand that. maybe start a conversation by saying that there's somethings that you've been dealing with and have felt too nervous to discuss with them and that you hope to get their full support when you disclose that stuff.
[2021-04-13 02:37:36] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: I've thought about it but I dislike my conversations or struggles being front-page news per say and I feel like that would likely be the result.
[2021-04-13 02:38:26] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i understand. have you thought about talking to them individually?
[2021-04-13 02:41:26] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: This is how it would likely happen. To them, it is nothing to screenshot a chat and send it to one another and talk about things whether to seek advice or just share. I understand that there is no harmful intention associated with it, generally. It just really bothers me and isn't the way I am.
[2021-04-13 02:42:15] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: do they screenshot texts from other people when they need help?
[2021-04-13 02:42:42] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: While some may share it seeking advice or wanting to find a way to support me, the others they share to may not have good intentions.
[2021-04-13 02:42:47] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: Yes.
[2021-04-13 02:44:20] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: have you guys ever discussed that with each other before?  like is everyone else comfortable with that?
[2021-04-13 02:45:20] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: All of them are comfortable with it. I just sit there confused by it.
[2021-04-13 02:45:43] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: can you tell them that you don't feel comfortable with it personally?
[2021-04-13 02:46:07] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: their reaction might help you understand how they would react to you discussing your issues.
[2021-04-13 02:49:02] (693627074212265994) birdz#2520: can someone dm if theyre good with mental health i need help
[2021-04-13 02:50:06] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: you can open a support ticket at <#824725472670908416>
[2021-04-13 02:51:58] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: I do. My boundary is very clear and is generally why they are comfortable talking to me because I'm not going to broadcast something they entrusted me with. Granted, it has also made it where they do not wish to talk to me despite my efforts at building friendships, leaving me socially connected but without the same friendship bonds...? If that makes sense.
[2021-04-13 02:52:48] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: honestly if they're not going to respect your boundaries then they're just being bad friends.
[2021-04-13 02:56:21] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: I can't call them good or bad friends because I do not know them well enough. I tend to keep people at arm's length whether intentional or unintentional.  However, I do need to begin working toward trying to form a support system. When I go through things, I isolate and that is an unhealthy coping mechanism haha.
[2021-04-13 02:57:19] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: that's a good idea but i think it's also good to form a support system with people that you know are going to make you feel validated rather than exposed.
[2021-04-13 02:58:59] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: Agreed. That is the goal. I just truly struggle with that. Being open is the most freeing or exposed feeling there is haha.
[2021-04-13 02:59:20] (443130730478960670) Alora ü•©#7138: We are the same way actually. We don't usually reach out to people.
[2021-04-13 03:01:12] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: Yeah :/, in that sense you could say none of us are alone. üôÇ
[2021-04-13 03:01:59] (443130730478960670) Alora ü•©#7138: It's one of the reasons Discord support is kinda nice. Everything is relatively anonymous and people don't have to get too involved in our life if we just need to vent or hear someone say 'That sucks.'
[2021-04-13 03:03:02] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: Yeah xD. I've never tried a server like this but I thought it could be a beneficial start for change or starting anew in a sense.

[2021-04-13 18:49:34] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: I was afriad of going, kinda am stil. But- it helped s, a lot. I was fraid that they were going to tell my paretns or people. Though they have been very nice, both times ive been, or both people. 

It'll help to go, but if you're not rady to tell someone face to face, maybe use a hotline? or... uh, an online chat thing. i did that at first, it helped.
[2021-04-13 18:51:26] (752935888782229584) _Riggs#9880: Yeah,the communication is a big factor too. I have a horrible time with verbal expression. I'm afraid I won't be able to get my point across in a way that they'll be able to understand
[2021-04-13 18:53:05] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: I have a hard time speaking too, so expressing things has been hard for me aswell. I try and express things using pictures or exprss pictures with words that decribe how i feel. or whats happening. But- if talking is hard, you can ask to write things down and have them respond too.
[2021-04-13 18:56:51] (752935888782229584) _Riggs#9880: Yeah

[2021-04-14 17:09:24] (443130730478960670) Alora ü•©#7138: Coffee, intense music, cold shower, or doing a bit of exercise are things we sometimes do to stay awake.

[2021-04-16 02:47:17] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Do you have access to a doctor? Or if you‚Äôre in school does your school have counselors? People on here can‚Äôt diagnose you (I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre asking for that tho) 
Also, when you say it‚Äôs not bad do you mean that it‚Äôs manageable or not bad in comparison to other things? Because it‚Äôs best to not compare struggles, but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre talking about
[2021-04-16 02:51:22] (830262586187579452) j0jo#2213: I am seeing my school counsellor but she is very busy. By "isn't that bad", I mean it's still manageable but it's still sort of affecting my grades/social skills.
[2021-04-16 02:55:35] (830262586187579452) j0jo#2213: but like I don't have depression
[2021-04-16 02:55:53] (830262586187579452) j0jo#2213: so, i think that means my anxiety isn't that bad?
[2021-04-16 02:57:40] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Depression and anxiety don‚Äôt always go hand in hand, and not everyone with a mental illness has depression.
If it‚Äôs affecting your grades and social skills it sounds like it‚Äôs something you should get checked on because, unfortunately, grades do matter for the future
[2021-04-16 02:58:22] (830262586187579452) j0jo#2213: yeah ty for the advice
[2021-04-16 02:58:48] (830262586187579452) j0jo#2213: really i just can't get myself to focus and i just sorta waste my time
[2021-04-16 02:58:57] (830262586187579452) j0jo#2213: that's why it's affecting my grades
[2021-04-16 03:02:46] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I try to get my school work done at the beginning of the day (or when I did in-person school, as soon as I got home) so that I could have the rest of the day to do whatever, but there are some days where I feel like I can‚Äôt do it and I have to do something unrelated for a bit (my go-to is either crochet or karaoke, I know it‚Äôs silly) and when I‚Äôm in a better headspace I do the work. But I‚Äôve been focused lately and honestly can‚Äôt really remember how i got out of the not being able to focus period of my life
[2021-04-16 08:27:09] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: Does anyone know how to deal with resentment and anger towards people, even if there is no reason to for it?
[2021-04-16 08:27:59] (437273191908376576) ReeyA#7915: write down every feeling and in detail, then try to find reasons
[2021-04-16 08:28:05] (437273191908376576) ReeyA#7915: thats the first step
[2021-04-16 08:28:19] (437273191908376576) ReeyA#7915: but idk mabe let your anger out?
[2021-04-16 08:28:39] (437273191908376576) ReeyA#7915: like punching or screaming
[2021-04-16 08:30:23] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: That‚Äôs a good idea.
[2021-04-16 10:28:36] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: I talked to the moon, and it said to me to calm down. I talked to the sun, and it said I'm crazy. I talked to my brain, and it said me to calm down. I talked to my heart and it said I'm crazy.... now I don¬¥t talk anymore, because the sun chase the moon, like the head chase the heart...
[2021-04-16 17:47:31] (724747479366631505) Mel06#5425: Hey, I am really struggling with executive dysfunction right now... I really need help
I have 40 exercises to hand in in a few hours and I have the motivation, I have specific goals, I have rewards, I have everything I need to focus, but I can‚Äôt start.
What do I do?
[2021-04-16 17:53:59] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: Just do one thing

[2021-04-16 20:12:08] (712404695548690434) Ani_LeWeeb#1812: PEOPLE OF THIS SERVER WHO HAS STRESS TOYS I NEED SOME ADVICE.
So within a month I broke 3 stress balls, so I need a different alternative from a stress ball that I can fidget with, throw, and punch
If I don't have something to fidget with I can't focus at all
[2021-04-16 20:13:18] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: hmm
[2021-04-16 20:14:07] (769963453603250189) Ifigeneia#3093: for me a tennis ball works you can throw it and all and it doesn't brake

[2021-04-16 20:17:54] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: have you tried the little plastic thingys that are on a string and you can like kinda shape them? I forget what they are called but they can be god
[2021-04-16 20:18:00] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: good not god
[2021-04-16 20:20:07] (712404695548690434) Ani_LeWeeb#1812: I have no idea what you're talking about but I'll try to find that

[2021-04-16 20:22:09] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: maybe try a hair elastic but for super thick hair

[2021-04-16 20:25:50] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: They are hard to break

[2021-04-16 20:29:51] (712404695548690434) Ani_LeWeeb#1812: Aight ty
[2021-04-16 20:30:01] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: ur welcome! Glad I could help
[2021-04-17 01:10:37] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Any advice for keeping therapy sessions concise and goal-oriented? Sometimes i go on tangents and I need help ^^;
[2021-04-17 01:11:52] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Do you write down what you‚Äôre planning to discuss before each session? Kinda like a to do list, that‚Äôs how I make sure not to forget anything
[2021-04-17 01:11:59] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: writing down the things you want to discuss!
[2021-04-17 01:12:15] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: <:acosp_doggasp:826698992854630440> weehehe beat me to it
[2021-04-17 01:12:36] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Weehehe üêß
[2021-04-17 01:15:38] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: off topic but do you have a nickname you prefer to be called or just weehehe
[2021-04-17 01:16:32] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Weehehe is fine! It‚Äôs easier to remember since it‚Äôs my discord name, but I also go by H (as in the letter oof). I don‚Äôt like my birth name hah
[2021-04-17 01:17:33] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Thank you guys!! I don't wanna interrupt but a to-do list sounds good. Ill try to take it slow because I always end up wanting to talk about 40 things, hehe. Thanks again guys!
[2021-04-17 01:17:48] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: that's fair lol. i don't either. but my family calls me H. so i guess we're twinning?
[2021-04-17 01:18:10] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: honestly i get off track too. i hope this works for you.
[2021-04-17 01:18:12] (430621608877490186) Rodger#0283: Hi H
[2021-04-17 01:19:22] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: That‚Äôs cool!!! I know a person irl who uses the first letter of their birth name but other than that I thought I was the s only one haha (I know your name is Jupiter I just have trouble explaining oof)
[2021-04-17 01:20:44] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i know plenty of people who hate their birthname. my bestfriend hates hers just cause she doesn't feel like it suits her.
[2021-04-17 01:21:08] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: Hey same
[2021-04-17 01:21:53] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: we're making an army of people who hate their birthname
[2021-04-17 01:22:09] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: Where can I get in on this
[2021-04-17 01:22:31] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: you signed up the moment you said "hey same"
[2021-04-17 01:22:37] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: Awesome!
[2021-04-17 01:23:34] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Same, thanks! :D
[2021-04-17 01:25:13] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: Oh same once do therapy for a while for some poeple it gets easier to talk about what they want to
[2021-04-17 01:25:45] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: well I mean... you still want to talk about those other thing but what yo want to get too
[2021-04-17 01:26:40] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I hope I can get better at it ^^;
[2021-04-17 01:28:04] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: You probably will! The therapist you are working with will also start to get an idea of what you are going off of vs. what you want to talk about and they may redirect the convo
[2021-04-17 01:30:52] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Argh but then I'll never talk about the important things XD
[2021-04-17 01:31:08] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Jk though, I think I'll figure out a balance!
[2021-04-17 01:31:20] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Also I realize I also kind of need help mentioning a preference to my therapist and whether I should mention it at all...
Personally, I feel more comfortable when my mental illnesses are referred to as mental illnesses or conditions vs saying that it is something else to "lighten" the load bc I understand taking care of a medical condition more than another way of thinking if that makes sense?
[2021-04-17 01:32:03] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: You should tottally say that to them if thats how you feel
[2021-04-17 01:32:09] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: also sorry I was on a phone and there's water in my case. Took me three years to type that lol
[2021-04-17 01:32:11] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: sorry to jump into the convo but i agree. i feel like calling it something else invalidates the fact that they are disorders
[2021-04-17 01:32:43] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels that way <:PensiveCowBread:798787405695549461>
[2021-04-17 01:33:31] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: And I'll try to just mention it then, because if I'm gonna be honest, saying it's a difficulty vs a disorder just makes me feel like I'm not trying hard enough when in reality it really *isn't* me, you know?
[2021-04-17 01:33:59] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: Yah I get that
[2021-04-17 01:35:05] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: sometimes I think therapists with say that so you know that right know it is a difficulty and isn't who you are you know? But you should definitley correct them if thats not how you feel
[2021-04-17 01:36:06] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Yeah I feel that way about calling them disorders, but a bit ago I was scared that others don‚Äôt feel that way so I referred to a mental illness as a ‚Äústruggle‚Äù  oof
[2021-04-17 01:37:57] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Oh yeah definitely, I've heard a few therapists say that this is a concern, and I think that's definitely valid. Just maybe in my case because I've been chronically ill from a young age I know it isn't me bc my chronic illness isn't me either but makes a *part* of me? Idk, I feel like medical stuff isn't made casual enough but maybe that's just me ^^;
[2021-04-17 01:38:39] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: If you feel that how they are saying something is invalidating you say something
[2021-04-17 01:39:11] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: And I think that's totally okay, I feel like there's nothing wrong in calling it a struggle because it is. Just in my personal case I feel weird abt it but that's totally valid I think, no matter how anyone thinks of it :>
[2021-04-17 01:39:35] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Yeah I think I'll let this new therapist know if she does something similar that it makes me feel uncomfy]
[2021-04-17 01:41:01] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: ok good!
[2021-04-17 01:42:11] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Thanks, y'alls! And I know it was a very weird sort of question but I'm glad you guys were able to help me out. It's a silly little thing but it actually heavily determines whether I take my disorder seriously in therapy for some reason **Orz**
[2021-04-17 01:43:23] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I've gotta go now but thanks guys! I appreciate it! :>
[2021-04-17 02:19:21] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: Okay so like
Idrk where to put this, its not really heavy or nsfw but also it may be triggering for some people ? Idk for sure
But anyway
||How long do pimples take to heal and is there anything I can do to make it go away faster, because i just have this one massive pimple and it kinda hurts when I touch it but its also itchy and I despise its existence||
[2021-04-17 02:20:11] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: ||Its been there for at least a week, if that means anything, and its kinda pink||
[2021-04-17 02:52:04] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: oh yes! touching it will only make is stay longer since you're irritating it and transferring oils
[2021-04-17 02:55:22] (814215847173685291) Chaotic Hellbender#1263: Try tea tree oils. They work like magic!
[2021-04-17 02:56:07] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: do you use diluted tea tree oil?
[2021-04-17 02:56:22] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: cause i only have the essential oil kind and i feel like that isn't safe
[2021-04-17 02:58:12] (814215847173685291) Chaotic Hellbender#1263: You can get sticks for like $5 at your local CVS, and they sell them online
[2021-04-17 02:58:32] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: they do? i've never seen them
[2021-04-17 02:59:29] (814215847173685291) Chaotic Hellbender#1263: If you are looking for them, you can usually find them.
[2021-04-17 03:00:00] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: thank you for this knowledge. i can finally deal with the random pimples i get once a month.
[2021-04-17 03:01:25] (814215847173685291) Chaotic Hellbender#1263: Yeah, tea tree oils and a royal jelly face wash work wonders on skin.

[2021-04-17 05:46:34] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: maybe drink some decaf tea if you have some, or try to get off your phone/computer because the blue light isn't good for sleeping.
[2021-04-17 05:50:31] (648920978650300416) Julia102#4848: I don't think I have any decaf tea and I haven't been on my phone until just now. I literally have been laying down with my eyes shut for like 2 hours straight.
[2021-04-17 05:51:05] (648920978650300416) Julia102#4848: :/

I told them I didnt want to work it but they told me to find coverage for it. I wasn't able to. They've scheduled me to work a double every Saturday for 3 weeks. Would it be mean if I tell them I can only work 7am till 6pm today?
[2021-04-17 12:32:16] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: I just want to go home and work on my homework and put my laundry away
[2021-04-17 12:37:44] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: They wanted me to work 16 hours today
[2021-04-17 12:39:13] (306814023603847179) lukaspirat#8434: is this overtime? because if so i dont think forcing overtime is legal it can be expected of someone but not needed
[2021-04-17 12:39:24] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: No they're not paying me more for it
[2021-04-17 12:41:06] (306814023603847179) lukaspirat#8434: paid overtime is still overtime
[2021-04-17 12:45:12] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Yea I guess
[2021-04-17 12:46:11] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Tbh idc if they pay me for it. I just don't want to overwork myself and end up back at a ||psych ward||
[2021-04-17 12:46:40] (306814023603847179) lukaspirat#8434: you need to know if they pay you for overtime that kind of an important detail
[2021-04-17 12:48:09] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: I guess?
[2021-04-17 12:49:14] (306814023603847179) lukaspirat#8434: but it might not be overtime could just be working reschedueling due to understaffed and corona
[2021-04-17 12:49:30] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Yea they are understaffed
[2021-04-17 12:50:28] (306814023603847179) lukaspirat#8434: then that might be it
[2021-04-17 12:53:30] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Yea
[2021-04-17 13:41:35] (443130730478960670) Alora ü•©#7138: <@!475476960164839426> they cannot force you to work double shifts if you choose not to. The scheduling is their responsibility, not yours. Also, depending on what industry you work in it may be illegal for them to not pay you overtime for working 16 hours in a day. We would flat out refuse that work if we were you.
[2021-04-17 17:20:32] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Yea I ended up leaving early because it was affecting my me tal health but they're asking me to come back to work the second part of the shift but I'm unsure if I can do it today
[2021-04-17 17:20:52] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: I'm also gonna have a conversation with them about it tommorow

[2021-04-18 05:10:48] (223951301682266112) Z.Cy23#3246: I completely know the feeling and I have been there. I suppose the best advice that I have for you that I have given myself is that for any new server you join, make sure that if you feel that heat and start getting angry, just log off and walk away. You may not be able to be unbanned but if you just walk away (I know it is hard but you can do it) and don't engage in the conversation at all for at least a half-hour (actually set a timer and keep your hands off the keys and your eyes off the screen).
[2021-04-18 05:10:52] (223951301682266112) Z.Cy23#3246: I hope this helps
[2021-04-18 23:29:09] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I felt really embarrassed some days during the week because I was getting very anxious and people were sort of... agitated about it? Even though I was trying to be honest about how I felt at the moment? (Like, I saw ||bugs|| and was honest about it and said those ||bugs|| are making me nervous, and they immediately looked at me with an annoyed look and asked "Really? Are you having a problem?")
After that I tried to stop showing my feelings about things and kind of went back into my shell to put up my persona but idk should I stop showing my emotions when I'm with people I feel like I can trust too? I just felt like they would understand but ig not
[2021-04-18 23:30:52] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Like I'm trying to be a more emotionally honest person but is telling people the things I have problems with not good? And how can I avoid situations like that?
[2021-04-18 23:54:00] (732296645940871308) Zombietitan1111#4596: i have been thinking about bad stuff and i have been thinking in my heasd and every day when i think my voice in my head is louder and im scared i said some stuff out loud wich where not the best... im not really sure what to do and im nurvus around some people (the people that i think heard me) i dont know what to do
[2021-04-19 00:00:27] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: If what's happening is scaring you, you should try talking to a professional or someone who you trust to let them know. Is professional help available to you?
[2021-04-19 00:02:53] (732296645940871308) Zombietitan1111#4596: no i dont have anyone who can help me and im scared to talk to someone they will prolly tell me im weird or something like that none the less probably hurt the relasionship i have built with these people
[2021-04-19 00:04:11] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Well, if they care about you, they won't think you're weird, or even if they do, they'll want to help you. If you can get professional help don't be afraid of that, because they've most likely had patients with "weirder" symptoms than you, I'm almost sure of it.
[2021-04-19 00:05:44] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Also, I guess something that could help you right now would probably be a grounding exercise, or something to make you feel calm and safe.

[2021-04-19 06:54:36] (559297387705794598) Akira#9262: First of all, kiddo, it's not your fault. It's also not your responsibility to stop them from fighting. Your parents have their own issues they need to solve that's between them. The best thing you can do is take care of yourself when the fights happen. Be kind to yourself, talk to a friend, get busy with your hobbies, make a favourite beverage etc. If you can, maybe take a short walk nearby to remove yourself from that stressful environment too. Just keep in mind that this isn't forever, one day you'll get to move out and not have to put up with their problems anymore. Lots of love until then. <:lots_of_love:712348017453432902>

As in, really just thinking about it and then thinking of reasons *why* you or the situation you're angry about could be good/bad and try to look at it in a neutral way. This helps me a lot. And then I just breathe out those feelings.
[2021-04-19 16:20:12] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Which I can understand if it doesn't work for you though because meditation is really hard for me
[2021-04-19 16:22:00] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: Meditating on it just makes me ticked off because it lets me feel and think on all of the causes of that anger. I do like mediating in general but meditating on the subjects ehhh. I can view stuff with reason and carry on, its just that pinned up anger will start to slip out in little ways.
[2021-04-19 16:22:27] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I can understand. So you reason out of it a lot of the time?
[2021-04-19 16:23:31] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: I don't really reason out of it lol. I just know how I should act verses how I feel and what I would like to say about it lol.
[2021-04-19 16:24:40] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: I go with what i should act like generally but hey, sometimes we all let a spiteful/rude comment slip from time to time.
[2021-04-19 16:25:20] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: I just really got to eliminate this stuff.
[2021-04-19 16:26:38] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I can understand. Maybe since you usually choose the way you're going to react, maybe set aside time to feel *everything*, let it out, and then just decompose almost. I struggle with anger at times and I find putting it aside only works for so long. But I understand what you mean! Do you have a therapist to talk to about it?
[2021-04-19 16:30:51] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: It usually makes time for itself in my schedule for sure lol. It's good to let stuff out. For me, I think because i've held in a bunch of stuff that when I let it out it is years worth of feelings and there is just a lotttt. So i never really just let it out and move on completely. I have a life coach I talk with every week or every other week but now it looks like im going to have to go to someone else which kind of stinks, i really got along with the one i have but he and my parents think it may be best to carry on with someone else in my journey.
[2021-04-19 16:32:53] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: tbh that kind of feels like garbage too
[2021-04-19 16:33:18] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: but i understand
[2021-04-19 16:33:40] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Alrighty, it sounds like you're putting in a lot of effort to try and help yourself so, I think that just letting it out it just going to take a while like you said. In the moment though, try what <@!760973651054428200> suggested because that can help when you feel anger rising to the surface all of a sudden. I think you will get better with time :>
[2021-04-19 16:34:41] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Definitely try out different forms of muscle relaxation though like Jacobsen's technique because that is like physically forcing out that pressure and then releasing it, you know? But good luck, I believe you will get better in due time :>
[2021-04-19 16:35:21] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: Okie dokie üôÇ Thank you guys! I appreciate it.

[2021-04-22 17:31:56] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I need advice on something...
I‚Äôve been ||suicidal|| all week, and I know that‚Äôs not a long time but it feels like the sadness will never go away üò¶ 
||I‚Äôve been honestly thinking about ending it pretty much every second...||
I have therapy in an hour and a half and I don‚Äôt know what to tell her. I don‚Äôt like to lie, but I don‚Äôt want to ||end up in a hospital and lose all my privacy|| but I don‚Äôt want to ||end up dead and have everyone find out how terrible I was either ||
I‚Äôve done ||outpatient partial hospitalization programs|| before. Twice. It was terrible. But Now I‚Äôm an adult and I‚Äôm scared that whatever I‚Äôll have to do to get myself out of this feeling will be even worse. 
||Outpatient|| obviously didn‚Äôt work in the long run, does that mean I‚Äôll be stuck in ||inpatient||? I‚Äôm so scared of that. I‚Äôve heard the ||‚Äúhorror stories‚Äù...||
Plus if I have to go ||inpatient||  my parents will never trust me enough to let me move out. And I‚Äôm almost 21 and I need to get away from this house. Ugh. 
Idk what to do. What do I tell my therapist? Does anyone have advice?
[2021-04-22 17:33:53] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Hey sorry I was typing with my own problems and I saw your message. I honestly don‚Äôt know how to clean wounds but it may be best to google it? Idk. Also I would recommend getting rid of whatever you ||sh|| with because it‚Äôs not a habit that you want to get stuck in. 
I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt have any better advice

[2021-04-22 17:39:16] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: there should be some kinda antiseptic spray, that is if you have it, just spray it on and cover it with something, or just keep it in the open.

I've been struggling with ||bpd|| and ||anorexia|| but I don't want to go to therapy because I don't want to change my habits or coping strategies even if they aren't healthy.

[2021-04-23 18:36:58] (475079130510000149) graemer#0036: Hi all, happy Friday. I‚Äôm here because I‚Äôm friends with a couple in Texas, and the wife has started exhibiting extremely intense symptoms of what he believes is either ||bipolar disorder or paranoid schizophrenia ||. He‚Äôs been struggling with taking her to see a doctor or resources, she refuses but she clearly needs to see a medical professional. Any resources that I can send to him?
[2021-04-23 18:39:13] (475079130510000149) graemer#0036: As far as I know, he was told by the police that they / a judge can only intervene if she becomes violent towards herself or others.  But we don‚Äôt want it to get to that point
[2021-04-23 18:44:54] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I don't want to give too much advice as I don't really know that much about specifics, and I don't want to force you to give too much information, but have you witnessed any of her symptoms? Because what I would recommend might require more than one person to be aware of the symptoms (to testify), and I would also hate for it to be a situation where one person *believes* someone to be ill, but they aren't (not saying this is the case)
[2021-04-23 18:47:48] (475079130510000149) graemer#0036: Thanks for responding. I‚Äôve spoken with them both in games and on discord several times a week for nearly a year, and had to take a break for a few months. When I spoke again I felt like I was taking to a different person. He‚Äôs family and friends who clearly see that there‚Äôs a problem.
[2021-04-23 18:48:48] (475079130510000149) graemer#0036: She has been violent with him
[2021-04-23 18:48:57] (475079130510000149) graemer#0036: But he hasn‚Äôt documented anything
[2021-04-23 18:54:29] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: No problem! And that's good that there are other people who have been listening. I'm sorry to hear that your friend may be becoming ill. I would say that maybe he could call 911 during one of her violent moments, but I would like to say that that is a very risky move, especially in the US. It could lead to a lot of unnecessary problems, methinks.

What I would recommend maybe is getting someone to talk with her when she seems clear-minded logically about the behavior, but not directed at her; as in, for example, if she threw things, just saying "I'm worried about how you might be feeling recently, and I wanted to talk to you about it. The other day when we were upset (not shifting the blame to her), you threw something, and I just wanted to know what got you upset, because I've never seen you throw something, and it worries me that you're not yourself."... or something like that. Idk.

Of course there's other options, but I think that might be a good step
[2021-04-23 18:55:52] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: If that ends up not working though I think in the US the only other options might be to do a welfare check but that also involves ||the police|| and might not work anyway because I'm assuming she doesn't live alone
[2021-04-23 18:57:11] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: also I think it wouldn't be a bad idea to start documenting her symptoms/behaviours/etc
[2021-04-23 18:57:44] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: it will also be useful if she sees treatment in the future
[2021-04-23 19:03:55] (475079130510000149) graemer#0036: That sounds about right

[2021-04-23 19:07:36] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Sit next to an extrovert, I think. That's how all of my introvert friends got friend groups, so it might work for social anxiety too. Not sure though, but I'm being totally honest. I am not joking
[2021-04-23 19:07:52] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: (has to be a nice extrovert though)

[2021-04-23 19:16:38] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: introverts are people who get energy from being alone, and extroverts are people who get energy from being with people! Of course, this is kind of scientifically inaccurate but people still say it XD

So, my friend invited me into a group chat with her other friend. Let's just say that her other friend's name is Dan and hers is Emma. Dan claimed that the Reaper Leviathan (from Subnautica) was his creation, I called him out for it. He left in embarrassment and was sad after he got called out, Emma got mad at me for calling him out. I don't understand. Dan was probably just a acquaintance to her, and I have been friends with her for 5 years. Why did she do this? HE CLAIMED THAT HE CREATED THE CREATURE. Emma is a great artist and hates when somebody steals her art and claims that her art is theirs. Dan was basically doing that but he's not stealing art!!
[2021-04-23 21:39:30] (732057094148194405) snuffy#8130: I mean I don‚Äôt see the problem with calling him out. Maybe he meant it as a joke, you‚Äôd probably know better than I. Maybe Emma and Dan are good friends, maybe there‚Äôs something deeper going on. There are too many variables, but all in all no-it‚Äôs fine that you said what you said.
