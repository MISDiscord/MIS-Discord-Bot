[2021-04-09 08:21:38] (768389205893578752) bloodovicha#3320: TW: social anxiety, mention of depression

Hi, I feel like an idiot. I have ||social anxiety and depression|| for reference. My social anxiety has been interfering with my life so much recently. I have a best friend, he's literally my everything. But whenever he doesn't respond I think he doesn't care about me or want to talk to me, when I know he's very busy usually. Yes, he tends to ghost people a lot, but thats for his own reasons and I shouldnt let that ruin my day, and even trigger me. I need help, but since I'm not 18 I can't ask for meds or anything. I don't know what to do. Am i too attatched? Is there a way I can aask for therapy/meds without my parents knowing (USA)?

[2021-04-09 15:19:04] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: I'm no expert, but when I get in a situation like that, I try and keep my mind aware of my breathing and keep it in check (regular and slow breaths). If I realize I'm getting worked up, my breathing tells me and I consciously try and slow it down and take deeper breaths. Might help with acute ||anxiety|| in some situations, plus nobody has to know you're doing it!

[2021-04-09 18:43:25] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Honestly, this kind of thing happens *all the time* but we only notice it when it happens to us, so it can seem like a huge disruption when it's really just a regular aspect of business and employment. The accepted, proper response by your co-workers should be congratulations and/or encouragement. Anyone who might respond negatively is acting 
inappropriately, in most cases. My advice would be to accept any kind words or praise that comes your way, because odds are you totally deserve it and are just being a bit tough on yourself! (aren't we all, sometimes?)

Nothing makes anyone better than loving themselves - I know you may not feel like it, but try and do something that is kind to yourself - make yourself some good soul food, and  curl up in front of netflix; or go for a walk and enjoy the sunshine... It doesn't make it go away, but small things like that give us the releases of dopamine and endorphins that can pick us up slightly. For me, I have found running great - the hardest part is getting out of bed, but that's exactly it - once your out you are one step closer to doing somethinng to make you feel better. You've got this dude!

Typically what you can look for is your first dose you will feel fine. Your body is first learning about how to fight off the spike proteins. The second dose you might feel a little off, but in all of the data I have found most people just feel a little off for one day and then are fully back to normal! Of course this has the possibility of being different, as everyone is unique. I am getting the ||Pfizer|| in 2 days. I can let you know how it goes!
[2021-04-12 13:07:50] (421837462047031297) Dkal#4012: Also to give a bit of reassurance. Both of my elderly grandparents have been ||vaccinated|| and are completely fine! For someone in their late 20s early 30s, I am confident you will be fine! (Note: I am not a medical professional, although I am referencing data and stories from people in the field. If you are concerned about it you should contact your primary care provider! )

[2021-04-12 13:26:35] (421837462047031297) Dkal#4012: In my personal and family's experience with ||vaccination||, typically you feel fine the first dose, and you feel a little off the second dose. Other than that there are no major side effects! Of course it is different for every person. If you are worried I would recommend you talk to your primary care provider for medical advice.
[2021-04-12 20:42:32] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Okay so, don't wanna bother anybody, but I sort of want advice in terms of disability and asking for assistance. I do believe that my GAD is a struggle for me on a daily basis as of now, and being overwhelmed really sets me back in some assignments, along with unhealthy habits. However, in the US where I live, you have to have paperwork from a psychiatrist or someone with a Dr. title to "prove" you have your disorder(s), but I only have docs from my therapist. Would it be worth making an appointment to get updated documents?
[2021-04-12 20:45:16] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Also, for context, I have accommodations for my physical disability but it just doesn't cover the full scope of issues I have
[2021-04-12 20:53:19] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: You are not bothering anyone üôÇ 
I live in the US and I agree that having a Dr. (or Psy NP under the supervision of a Dr.)  officially document any conditions in question is only going to help you get care more easily and sooner. I'm no expert, but I can see how it would totally be worth the time and effort getting things fully-documented.
[2021-04-12 20:55:58] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Alright, thank you, I *really* appreciate the help. Everyone within my "support" team has advised that I do *not* seek extra help, even when organizations have offered them to me, as they told me that as I get better I will not need the help... but I still think it would make sense, even if it is a long and confusing process to find said Drs. Thank you!
[2021-04-12 21:02:17] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Better to have it in place and not need it! Sounds kind of odd to tell someone not to get help, but I cannot speak for those individuals and I'm not a psych professional, granted.
[2021-04-12 21:14:01] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Thanks for your input, I think that makes sense! And yeah it's strange all around, even to some organizations as I said lol.

[2021-04-13 02:19:29] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: How do you build a support system with individuals who are unable to comprehend how you feel? I am generally the encourager in the majority of my friend groups but I am usually unable to be open about my struggles because it is met with judgment, inability to comprehend/respond, or nothing at all. I have a hard time distinguishing whether support is a want or a need, but I think that when I am really struggling it is more of a need. I just downplay it. I seldomly express a need for support because I want to be a strong rock for people, which I think is why I feel it is major when I do express the need, and when that verbalized need goes unnoticed my brain registers that as devastating rejection. My dilemma is knowing you must communicate a need for people to know and support you but not wishing to verbalize them and be met with painful silence in addition to not knowing how to establish a support system in friend groups.  Any suggestions for a starting point?

However, they tend to be naive, only recognizing some people's needs while excluding the recognition of others, such as myself.  I think this is ultimately because some repetitively and emphatically express a need whereas others like myself only express a need when things are severe, if at all.
[2021-04-13 02:33:36] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i understand that. maybe start a conversation by saying that there's somethings that you've been dealing with and have felt too nervous to discuss with them and that you hope to get their full support when you disclose that stuff.
[2021-04-13 02:37:36] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: I've thought about it but I dislike my conversations or struggles being front-page news per say and I feel like that would likely be the result.
[2021-04-13 02:38:26] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i understand. have you thought about talking to them individually?
[2021-04-13 02:41:26] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: This is how it would likely happen. To them, it is nothing to screenshot a chat and send it to one another and talk about things whether to seek advice or just share. I understand that there is no harmful intention associated with it, generally. It just really bothers me and isn't the way I am.
[2021-04-13 02:42:15] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: do they screenshot texts from other people when they need help?
[2021-04-13 02:42:42] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: While some may share it seeking advice or wanting to find a way to support me, the others they share to may not have good intentions.
[2021-04-13 02:42:47] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: Yes.
[2021-04-13 02:44:20] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: have you guys ever discussed that with each other before?  like is everyone else comfortable with that?
[2021-04-13 02:45:20] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: All of them are comfortable with it. I just sit there confused by it.
[2021-04-13 02:45:43] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: can you tell them that you don't feel comfortable with it personally?
[2021-04-13 02:46:07] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: their reaction might help you understand how they would react to you discussing your issues.
[2021-04-13 02:49:02] (693627074212265994) birdz#2520: can someone dm if theyre good with mental health i need help
[2021-04-13 02:50:06] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: you can open a support ticket at <#824725472670908416>
[2021-04-13 02:51:58] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: I do. My boundary is very clear and is generally why they are comfortable talking to me because I'm not going to broadcast something they entrusted me with. Granted, it has also made it where they do not wish to talk to me despite my efforts at building friendships, leaving me socially connected but without the same friendship bonds...? If that makes sense.
[2021-04-13 02:52:48] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: honestly if they're not going to respect your boundaries then they're just being bad friends.
[2021-04-13 02:56:21] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: I can't call them good or bad friends because I do not know them well enough. I tend to keep people at arm's length whether intentional or unintentional.  However, I do need to begin working toward trying to form a support system. When I go through things, I isolate and that is an unhealthy coping mechanism haha.
[2021-04-13 02:57:19] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: that's a good idea but i think it's also good to form a support system with people that you know are going to make you feel validated rather than exposed.
[2021-04-13 02:58:59] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: Agreed. That is the goal. I just truly struggle with that. Being open is the most freeing or exposed feeling there is haha.
[2021-04-13 02:59:20] (443130730478960670) Alora ü•©#7138: We are the same way actually. We don't usually reach out to people.
[2021-04-13 03:01:12] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: Yeah :/, in that sense you could say none of us are alone. üôÇ
[2021-04-13 03:01:59] (443130730478960670) Alora ü•©#7138: It's one of the reasons Discord support is kinda nice. Everything is relatively anonymous and people don't have to get too involved in our life if we just need to vent or hear someone say 'That sucks.'
[2021-04-13 03:03:02] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: Yeah xD. I've never tried a server like this but I thought it could be a beneficial start for change or starting anew in a sense.
[2021-04-13 07:07:44] (430621608877490186) Rodger#0283: Can anyone with tics give  me some help
[2021-04-13 18:02:30] (783395108379688990) decapitated cookie#7893: Bro.
[2021-04-13 18:02:33] (783395108379688990) decapitated cookie#7893: I need advice.
[2021-04-13 18:02:44] (805758896773398538) pumpkin (they/she)#1231: what's up?
[2021-04-13 18:02:53] (783395108379688990) decapitated cookie#7893: Are you going to judge me?
[2021-04-13 18:03:00] (805758896773398538) pumpkin (they/she)#1231: no ofc not
[2021-04-13 18:03:14] (783395108379688990) decapitated cookie#7893: Ok.
[2021-04-13 18:35:27] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: I can try if you still want help??
[2021-04-13 18:46:16] (752935888782229584) _Riggs#9880: I'm afraid of going to a therapist bc I think they might try to hurt me or downplay my symptoms
[2021-04-13 18:49:34] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: I was afriad of going, kinda am stil. But- it helped s, a lot. I was fraid that they were going to tell my paretns or people. Though they have been very nice, both times ive been, or both people. 

It'll help to go, but if you're not rady to tell someone face to face, maybe use a hotline? or... uh, an online chat thing. i did that at first, it helped.
[2021-04-13 18:51:26] (752935888782229584) _Riggs#9880: Yeah,the communication is a big factor too. I have a horrible time with verbal expression. I'm afraid I won't be able to get my point across in a way that they'll be able to understand
[2021-04-13 18:53:05] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: I have a hard time speaking too, so expressing things has been hard for me aswell. I try and express things using pictures or exprss pictures with words that decribe how i feel. or whats happening. But- if talking is hard, you can ask to write things down and have them respond too.
[2021-04-13 18:56:51] (752935888782229584) _Riggs#9880: Yeah
[2021-04-13 18:57:03] (752935888782229584) _Riggs#9880: Guess I'll have to figure something out eventually
[2021-04-13 18:57:10] (752935888782229584) _Riggs#9880: Thanks for the tips
[2021-04-13 18:57:25] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: i trie

[2021-04-14 14:24:13] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: I want to do a voice chat and cam with a close friend but I‚Äôm scared of it being unsafe or that this friend I‚Äôm talking to will somehow find info about me when we do a vc or a cam.
[2021-04-14 14:25:10] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: Even when I‚Äôm just doing a voice chat, it feels so unsafe and there‚Äôs always that voice back in my mind, wondering if my voice is being recorded or can people find personal info about me through my voice.
[2021-04-14 15:26:15] (673611542419472438) JamJar#7479: Rember to not do anything that makes you too much uncomfy.
[2021-04-14 17:07:25] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: Does anyone have advice on staying awake? lol. My body just wants to go in sleep mode and time feels like it is moving slow when in reality it is flying by. I have a lot to accomplish today and my energy is sadly zapped.
[2021-04-14 17:09:24] (443130730478960670) Alora ü•©#7138: Coffee, intense music, cold shower, or doing a bit of exercise are things we sometimes do to stay awake.
[2021-04-14 17:18:33] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: I try those, same thing sadly. ||caffeinated drinks|| like coffee can help. However, it will give me a mega surge of energy and then a severe nose dive afterward.
[2021-04-14 18:25:35] (686421206680731649) ùöéùöñùöéùöõùöí#5346: honestly i suggest taking a power nap, or shutting your eyes for a bit. it sounds counter productive but sometimes when i get really tired i lay down for a bit, listen to some music, let myself have a moment of relaxation. it helps get a bit of motivation and a small feeling of being rested
[2021-04-14 18:28:12] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: In between classes or after, I'll sleep a lot of times. It may just be getting a better sleep schedule in my case.
