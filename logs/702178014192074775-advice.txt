[2021-04-09 08:21:38] (768389205893578752) bloodovicha#3320: TW: social anxiety, mention of depression

Hi, I feel like an idiot. I have ||social anxiety and depression|| for reference. My social anxiety has been interfering with my life so much recently. I have a best friend, he's literally my everything. But whenever he doesn't respond I think he doesn't care about me or want to talk to me, when I know he's very busy usually. Yes, he tends to ghost people a lot, but thats for his own reasons and I shouldnt let that ruin my day, and even trigger me. I need help, but since I'm not 18 I can't ask for meds or anything. I don't know what to do. Am i too attatched? Is there a way I can aask for therapy/meds without my parents knowing (USA)?

I feel like I don't know how to have meaningful conversations or connect with people anymore

[2021-04-09 12:22:27] (695958514077663242) newberiepie#4788: I feel like I've been making a lot of bad decisions and I've been doing it because I'm scared of confronting them
[2021-04-09 12:23:13] (695958514077663242) newberiepie#4788: I freeze every time I get into an argument, like I don't know what to say. I'm scared to say the wrong thing to keep a good relationship
[2021-04-09 12:23:36] (695958514077663242) newberiepie#4788: I guess I feel like I don't have anyone I can talk to heart to heart without hurting the other person
[2021-04-09 13:00:21] (695958514077663242) newberiepie#4788: Not sure if this is the right room for this, but anyone can point me to the right direction? üòÖüòÖ

If I realize I'm getting worked up, my breathing tells me and I consciously try and slow it down and take deeper breaths. Might help with acute ||anxiety|| in some situations, plus nobody has to know you're doing it!
[2021-04-09 17:19:02] (797694570753687594) PaddyWhack643#2177: I'm quitting my job today(putting a two week notice in) and I'm stfo. How should I do it? I dont want to let them down. But I have a new job starting in two weeks. Any advice?

[2021-04-09 18:43:25] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Honestly, this kind of thing happens *all the time* but we only notice it when it happens to us, so it can seem like a huge disruption when it's really just a regular aspect of business and employment. The accepted, proper response by your co-workers should be congratulations and/or encouragement. Anyone who might respond negatively is acting 
inappropriately, in most cases. My advice would be to accept any kind words or praise that comes your way, because odds are you totally deserve it and are just being a bit tough on yourself! (aren't we all, sometimes?)
