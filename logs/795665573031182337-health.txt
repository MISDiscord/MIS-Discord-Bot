I force myself to stay awake until I black out.

Haven't slept in three days.
Today I didn't even do it on purpose, I just didn't sleep.

I was going to try and fix my sleep schedule by staying up an extra night then sleeping early, but I haven't fallen asleep yet.
I don't feel tired or anything either.

yeah okay that's it

I'm recovering from an ||eating disorder|| and ||self harm||, I have been through a lot, i don't talk about it because i find that my pain and feelings aren't valid. Sometimes i think that maybe it's best if i became numb.. There is a possibility i have depression and ADHD, I used to live with my father that was ||an alcoholic and abusive||. I have trust issues and I'm really scared of most men a year or more older then me... I don't really talk about who i am that much because I'm not valid and people are going through worse than i have/am going through. I have really bad ||suicidal thoughts|| and bad urges to ||self harm|| but it's normal for me...

I've been struggling with ||bpd|| and ||anorexia|| but I don't want to go to therapy because I don't want to change my habits or coping strategies even if they aren't healthy.

I'm not ||dying|| of my ||ed || like last time, so it's not even bad. Is it okay that I don't want therapy?

So like... lately I feel low for no reason. Do you guys think it could be my lack of energy manifesting? Or do you think I just need to exercise or something to try to correct it? idk what I would be able to do, but it has been getting worse as my burnout gets worse.
[2021-04-23 13:12:07] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Because when I "feel low", my ||blood sugar|| could be around ||130, 140, etc. which is obviously not low||
