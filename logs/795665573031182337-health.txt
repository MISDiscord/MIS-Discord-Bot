I force myself to stay awake until I black out.

Haven't slept in three days.
Today I didn't even do it on purpose, I just didn't sleep.

I was going to try and fix my sleep schedule by staying up an extra night then sleeping early, but I haven't fallen asleep yet.
I don't feel tired or anything either.

yeah okay that's it

I have trust issues and I'm really scared of most men a year or more older then me... I don't really talk about who i am that much because I'm not valid and people are going through worse than i have/am going through.

So like... lately I feel low for no reason. Do you guys think it could be my lack of energy manifesting? Or do you think I just need to exercise or something to try to correct it? idk what I would be able to do, but it has been getting worse as my burnout gets worse.
[2021-04-23 13:12:07] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Because when I "feel low", my ||blood sugar|| could be around ||130, 140, etc. which is obviously not low||

[2021-04-24 21:19:03] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: i personally like profiling because of the reactions ive gotten out of people
[2021-04-24 21:19:42] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: its fun to be in a call and tell whoever what their thinking and feel the energy of fascination, interest and confusion
[2021-04-24 21:20:44] (467747778622259221) greywolfember#0072: oh /definitely/ yeah I hear that
[2021-04-24 21:20:54] (467747778622259221) greywolfember#0072: I've profiled a bit before though idk how well I do with it
[2021-04-24 21:21:01] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: makes me feel like a fucking magician lmao
[2021-04-24 21:21:19] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: see- for me i find it easier to do with people that really interest me
[2021-04-24 21:21:34] (467747778622259221) greywolfember#0072: I think where I do the most is when I'm analysing people I know well and going deep into behaviour and who I think they are etc. and when I'm right and explain something they hadn't realised about themselves before
[2021-04-24 21:21:52] (467747778622259221) greywolfember#0072: oh huh, say more?
[2021-04-24 21:22:02] (467747778622259221) greywolfember#0072: interested! and a lil confused :P
[2021-04-24 21:22:44] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: its hard to explain so bare with me lmao
[2021-04-24 21:22:59] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: i feel like the easiest way to put it is- you know those people you just click with?
[2021-04-24 21:23:10] (467747778622259221) greywolfember#0072: Yeah
[2021-04-24 21:23:16] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: meeting those people and having a small click makes me very interested
[2021-04-24 21:23:50] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: and i think i have a habit of writing down a sort of mental notes on those people? im unsure about it because my memory is absolutely terrible
[2021-04-24 21:24:29] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: i remember doing it with someone and like- counting a couple moves ahead ina way, like a chess game
[2021-04-24 21:24:56] (467747778622259221) greywolfember#0072: ohhh I think I know what you mean yeah

[2021-04-24 21:25:15] (467747778622259221) greywolfember#0072: observation and then deduction
[2021-04-24 21:25:26] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: mhm!!
[2021-04-24 21:26:07] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: i cant remember the memories itself very well but i remember the interest spark in them and i remember me getting excited over it because they found it interesting
[2021-04-24 21:26:29] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: i tend to remember how i feel in the memory but not much on what exactly happened
[2021-04-24 21:26:59] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: sort of like- recalling you stubbing your toe- most people can probably play it out in their head like a movie and recall every step
[2021-04-24 21:27:26] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: i can only recall the negative emotion really, not where it was, when it was or any of that
[2021-04-24 21:28:24] (467747778622259221) greywolfember#0072: oh man yeah I definitely get that
[2021-04-24 21:28:47] (467747778622259221) greywolfember#0072: I can sometimes do the playing it out in my head and sometimes I just remember the emotion and flashes and info
[2021-04-24 21:28:52] (467747778622259221) greywolfember#0072: not images really but flashes of more memory
[2021-04-24 21:29:22] (467747778622259221) greywolfember#0072: that's really interesting ty for sharing :DD
[2021-04-24 21:31:54] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: mhm!! its kinda interesting to talk about
[2021-04-24 21:32:15] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: interesting and hard, expressing myself and explain things about myself ive always struggled with lmao

[2021-04-25 20:16:34] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i definitely recommend a heating pad or a heated water bottle since that helps best

[2021-04-25 21:05:04] (467747778622259221) greywolfember#0072: a small amount of ginger-honey water might help

[2021-04-27 23:10:38] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Guys I need some advice health wise
[2021-04-27 23:11:55] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: I've been having issues where I'm constantly tired. Like I've been asleep more than I've been awake these past two days. It could be that I just started my ||meds|| and it's only been a week but it's been going on for years now.i started taking womens vitamins hoping it helps somewhat?
[2021-04-27 23:42:55] (732057094148194405) snuffy#8130: Do you have a consistent sleep schedule?
[2021-04-28 00:57:41] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Not particularly
[2021-04-28 00:57:49] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: I normally go to sleep at 12 at night
[2021-04-28 00:59:29] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: low in iron maybe? take some ||iron supplements|| and see if it helps.
[2021-04-28 01:00:00] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Do you think womens health vitamins is enough or nah?
[2021-04-28 01:00:10] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: I'm guessing it includes iron??
[2021-04-28 01:00:37] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: I honestly do not know, I've never read the bottles or used them.
[2021-04-28 01:01:08] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: I'll have to read it when I get home
[2021-04-28 01:02:41] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: okay, yeah, iron is usually the way to go if you're super tired. My iron was (still is) really low and I took supplements for a while and felt a lot more energized.
[2021-04-28 01:05:43] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: I'm gonna go buy some now!
[2021-04-28 01:07:06] (648312904940257281) Simo#0999: this might be against rule 6
[2021-04-28 01:09:30] (732057094148194405) snuffy#8130: It may be beneficial to try and go to sleep at an earlier time consistently. Eating three healthy meals and exercising in particular help me stay awake, and it’s also fun depending on the exercise.
[2021-04-28 01:10:01] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: sorry
[2021-04-28 01:10:50] (648312904940257281) Simo#0999: I'm not a mod
I could be wrong
[2021-04-28 01:11:36] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Yea I definitely need to work on the healthy meals and exercise
[2021-04-28 01:13:39] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: yeah, sorta just apologizing in advance if it did break the rules.
[2021-04-28 01:15:42] (732057094148194405) snuffy#8130: Once you get into the habit you won’t want out of it, it makes ya feel great!
[2021-04-28 01:20:24] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: I hope I caaan
[2021-04-28 01:24:31] (732057094148194405) snuffy#8130: I’m sure ya can with enough dedication!
