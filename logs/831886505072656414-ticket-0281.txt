[2021-04-14 13:40:21] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I got asked to file a ticket
[2021-04-14 13:40:48] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: if you want to argue about your punishment you can do so here but mods have final say and decide punishments
[2021-04-14 13:40:56] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I know
[2021-04-14 13:41:36] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I personally think for fucking up this badly I should suffer as much as possible
[2021-04-14 13:42:01] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: Especially for making others feel bad
[2021-04-14 13:42:36] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I have one question Alissa
[2021-04-14 13:42:42] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: The punishment should hurt more than a mere warning
[2021-04-14 13:43:48] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: At least from everything I've experienced
[2021-04-14 13:44:21] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: It doesn't feel right to only get a warning
[2021-04-14 13:44:58] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: alright alissa, for arguing with mods, constant guilt tripping, putting triggering content in light channels, you’re going to be banned
