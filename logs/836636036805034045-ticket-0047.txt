[2021-04-27 16:15:50] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: Just a couple of questions for you, we’ve had a couple reports of you invalidating other users by saying some of the things they are struggling with , are not real. could you shed some light onto the situation and why you’re doing so as you’re not a trainer professional?
[2021-04-27 16:16:50] (776545200741941248) crow system#6180: I have never said anything like that on the server nor has any one of us
[2021-04-27 16:18:27] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: just to clarify, you’re denying any and all claims? specifically saying that another user is faking their dissociation and should remove their role?
[2021-04-27 16:18:48] (776545200741941248) crow system#6180: I have never said any of that
[2021-04-27 16:19:09] (776545200741941248) crow system#6180: I don’t know who would’ve said I told them that but just to be clear I keep we keep track of everything that everyone says

[2021-04-27 16:25:15] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: unfortunately we have received reports from a couple of users that this happened in a group dm vc. harassing someone about their disorders is never okay, be it in the server or anywhere else.

As you and everyone else deny all knowledge of this incident despite the overwhelming evidence. You will be warned, and i will not take as lightly if it happens again.
[2021-04-27 16:35:55] (776545200741941248) crow system#6180: Ok I am vary sorry that this has happened and I will Be sure to let everyone else know that that was not OK
