[2021-04-30 08:01:04] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: Hello
[2021-04-30 11:02:51] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: <@&801517796709498881>
[2021-04-30 12:16:32] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: <@834132395014750269> Sorry, I think most of our team was asleep when you pinged, I‚Äôm up now though. How can I help?
[2021-04-30 12:37:35] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: Where can I freely talk about religion in this server?
[2021-04-30 12:37:45] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: I am having mental issues related to religion
[2021-04-30 12:37:53] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: And no one is willing to help me because it breaks the rules
[2021-04-30 12:38:18] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: I am trying to break free from a religion but it seems this discussion is against the rules
[2021-04-30 12:42:56] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: It should be fine here! And it is okay if it is directly related to mental health so long as it is not an antagonistic conversation too
[2021-04-30 12:43:24] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: What's going on?
[2021-04-30 13:47:47] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: So
[2021-04-30 13:47:51] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: I have focus issues
[2021-04-30 13:47:55] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: When studying
[2021-04-30 13:48:04] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: And I cannot focus even when exams are near
[2021-04-30 13:48:07] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: When I can't focus
[2021-04-30 13:48:13] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: I think to myself that
[2021-04-30 13:48:17] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: buddha will help me
[2021-04-30 13:48:35] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: I always expect that buddha will create a natural event to delay the exam
[2021-04-30 13:48:50] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: or expect that buddha will magically increase my chance for success
[2021-04-30 13:49:43] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: I went to many professional fortune tellers and everyone told me that I will succeed by studying hard
[2021-04-30 13:50:21] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: Because of this I expect buddha to make me succeed on the exam, even if I be lazy and not study
[2021-04-30 13:50:27] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: I always fail my exam this way
[2021-04-30 13:50:38] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: I tried to think that buddha won't help me if I am lazy
[2021-04-30 13:50:47] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: But because I cannot fix my focus issues for years
[2021-04-30 13:51:01] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: I always resort to thinking that buddha will unleash his magical powers to save me
[2021-04-30 13:51:10] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: How do I stop thinking like this?
[2021-04-30 13:51:21] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: I keep thinking that I have a power to not fail
[2021-04-30 13:51:33] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: I keep misunderstanding myself as the 'chosen one'
[2021-04-30 13:51:46] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: <@!214852868837081089>
[2021-04-30 13:53:50] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: Well, you've already made progress if you've realized that it's causing you a problem. Faith is not a bad thing but it is important for you to help yourself too
[2021-04-30 13:55:04] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: Having trouble focusing can be a problem that needs professional help though. Have you talked to a medical professional before?
[2021-04-30 13:55:55] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: <@!214852868837081089> My mother wont let me go to a doctor
[2021-04-30 13:56:05] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: She said I am using disorders as an excuse for my laziness
[2021-04-30 13:56:11] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: People think I just hate studying
[2021-04-30 13:56:23] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: Because this is asia I am not allowed to go outside
[2021-04-30 13:56:27] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: without permission
[2021-04-30 13:57:55] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: Oof, that makes things more difficult. First of all, you should know that having problems with executive functioning (getting stuff done) is NOT laziness
[2021-04-30 13:58:50] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: <@!214852868837081089> Well I went to an adhd community in korea and the people with adhd said my laziness is not related to adhd
[2021-04-30 13:58:59] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: They said I just hate studying
[2021-04-30 13:59:06] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: Those people said adhd is for memorizing problems
[2021-04-30 13:59:17] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: Not laziness
[2021-04-30 13:59:26] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: Then I got banned for 'using adhd as an excuse'
[2021-04-30 14:01:38] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: I can't tell you whether or not you have adhd but having trouble with executive functioning is a symptom. That being said, that does not mean you have it, there are other reasons why you may be having trouble
[2021-04-30 14:02:12] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: <@!214852868837081089> Well I am sure that i dont have disorder
[2021-04-30 14:02:16] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: I want to stop being spoiled
[2021-04-30 14:02:21] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: I wanna stop being lazy
[2021-04-30 14:02:24] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: I want to be smart
[2021-04-30 14:02:32] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: I have fear for future
[2021-04-30 14:02:36] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: but i cant focus
[2021-04-30 14:04:04] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: Having those feelings is admirable! It's good to want to improve yourself. I don't think you're being lazy or spoiled if you have trouble focusing. There's a difference between not wanting to do something and not being able to
[2021-04-30 14:05:35] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: <@!214852868837081089> Well I end up watching youtube videos instead of studying
[2021-04-30 14:05:37] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: Now, there's only so much I can do but if you'd like, we can try to think up some methods to help you focus? Or we can keep chatting and you can tell me more about how you feel
[2021-04-30 14:05:48] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: I keep thinking that I would be able to finish my work later
[2021-04-30 14:05:53] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: And I get bored easily
[2021-04-30 14:08:02] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: You get bored of studying?
[2021-04-30 14:09:44] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: Yes
[2021-04-30 14:10:03] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: I don't like studying, but I do it because I want to achieve something
[2021-04-30 14:16:59] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: I think most people feel that way üòÅ
[2021-04-30 14:17:08] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: I'm not a huge fan of studying either
[2021-04-30 14:17:24] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: But it is important!
[2021-04-30 18:14:54] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: Hello
[2021-04-30 18:15:45] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: Hello! How are you doing?
