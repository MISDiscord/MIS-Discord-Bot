[2021-04-14 16:56:26] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: It's the end of the semester of my final year at college, I'm getting ready to go to an expensive out-of-country grad school, my mental health isn't the best and my new medication is causing side effects. I should be overwhelmed beyond belief and while it's a lot to keep track of, I'm managing, almost entirely because of my dad.

He's been insanely understanding and supportive this final year. I feel like I can really trust him and while money is only part of the help he's giving me, the knowledge that I have help in that regard has given me so much peace of mind. He's just an incredible father and I wanted to put that out there!

SO! man when i first got here you were sweet and i adore that very much, i can understand that things can have a toll on you and thats okay to get stressed out about it. just remember its totally okay to take a second to breathe and let yourself essentially "let go of the reins" i dunno what youre dealing with right now. so im trying to cover little bits from the roles ive noticed you have! remember to let yourself breathe and not to overwhelm yourself, its okay to take a second to slow down and look at what you have, even if that in itself is hard to do. but i know you have before! even if you dont realize youve done it before, sometimes its a habit of sorts i feel is the best way to put it. im happy youve done it before and i know you can do it again, just remember you have people to lean on if you need it, we all love you!
[2021-04-23 13:33:13] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: paraa youre up too!
i havent known you for long but i totally LOVE the positive vibes you bring here. thanks for all of that man!! just remember to take bouncy positivity slow because sometimes it can be draining and we all understand that! remember to take care of yourself and fix that sleeping schedule, i dont exactly remember if its you who has the one where its all over the place but still! my point stands, if you need we can all provide little guides or tips on how to help sleep, im sure alot of people here can understand how having an odd sleeping schedule is. and that can be hard to fix on its own, remember to keep nerding out about your interests too! sure not everyone can understand some pieces of it but dont let that discourage you because we all love hearing it! we all love you too!
