[2021-04-14 16:56:26] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: It's the end of the semester of my final year at college, I'm getting ready to go to an expensive out-of-country grad school, my mental health isn't the best and my new medication is causing side effects. I should be overwhelmed beyond belief and while it's a lot to keep track of, I'm managing, almost entirely because of my dad.

He's been insanely understanding and supportive this final year. I feel like I can really trust him and while money is only part of the help he's giving me, the knowledge that I have help in that regard has given me so much peace of mind. He's just an incredible father and I wanted to put that out there!
