[2021-04-16 14:33:23] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: Hello <@427903354723631114> we have a policy on this server against dming moderators regarding personal support or moderator decisions. It is not acceptable to continue to message a moderator after they’ve told you to keep things regarding support on the server. This violates rule 9 and you will get a warning as a result.

[2021-04-16 14:45:39] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: "do you mind if we move to the server to discuss more serious topics since i like to keep my dms free from support stuff" when u said tht i thought I could ask the channel
[2021-04-16 14:45:53] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: sorry if I couldn't
[2021-04-16 14:46:03] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: it wasn't my intention...
[2021-04-16 14:47:11] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: I understand if u give me a warning
[2021-04-16 14:49:57] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: All support services and moderation queries need to go through the server unless both parties explicitly give consent for it to be moved into dms, mods’ dms can be become very cluttered which makes it hard to be able to separate our own lives from the server. thank you for your understanding
[2021-04-16 14:50:49] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: I see... I thought I have asked...
[2021-04-16 14:53:05] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: just give me a warning, even if I am right (I didnt said  I am) I don't want to be banned from this server because  of persisting on this
[2021-04-16 14:55:16] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: I was banned from a few servers last months because people wouldnt hear to me and stayed cynic about being right even if I had the proof ... this has nothing to deal with u guys... it's just a fact tht I dont want to happen again
[2021-04-16 14:55:51] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: maybe I should leave this server... its a lot better than being banned...
[2021-04-16 14:56:41] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: we also don’t allow guilt tripping within the server. a moderator asked you to stop dming them and you continued, thus breaking our rules. you will have 2 strikes for this action.
[2021-04-16 14:57:08] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: what.. I... did I?
[2021-04-16 14:57:14] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: can u ping me pls?
[2021-04-16 14:57:51] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: ping you? as in <@427903354723631114> ?
[2021-04-16 15:01:30] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: no.. ah, forget it... I thought I did everything right... I asked Jupiter if I could dm, then when jupiter said yes, I did it, and when Jupiter said to move to the server I did... today I sent apology's because I thought I hurted Jupiter... and I thought tht saying good morning after tht would be nice to relief the situation..................... But it seems I was wrong I- I can't express how ashamed I feel to hurt someone and to violate the server rules...
[2021-04-16 15:01:58] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: will I be banned?
[2021-04-16 15:02:37] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: no you won’t be banned, you will have 2 strikes , further breaking of the rules will eventually lead to a ban yes
[2021-04-16 15:02:58] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: the only thing i can do now is to regret and say sorry...
[2021-04-16 15:03:42] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: I can't believe I messed things up again
[2021-04-16 15:04:07] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: ok let’s not dwell, you’ve realised it was wrong and we can move on from the situation
[2021-04-16 15:05:20] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: I wont be typing here and to no one, but I cant tell you tht I wont dwell
[2021-04-16 15:05:34] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: okay can i close this ticket now?
[2021-04-16 15:05:39] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: pls
