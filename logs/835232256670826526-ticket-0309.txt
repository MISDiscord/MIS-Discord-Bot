[2021-04-23 19:18:49] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Hi. Sorry about that. Basically what happened was when I had the support role I tried to be supportive for Student, but I think I failed and now I think student left the server so I know there’s nothing I can do about it. The thing was after we were pretty much done talking, they said that the people on the server didn’t really appreciate them at all or care enough to check on them. I was going to check on student the next day but I didn’t because stuff happened in my life that made me super upset, and also I didn’t want them thinking i was checking up on them out of pity. But now I feel like I was the last straw and I tried to check up on them after they left the server but it wouldn’t send. I just feel guilty I don’t know exactly what I’m asking about, but I feel like I caused something bad
