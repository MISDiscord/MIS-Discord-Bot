[2021-04-23 00:02:40] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: Yeah paranoia can do that
[2021-04-23 00:03:08] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: Um do you think if you cook the food you could eat it
[2021-04-23 00:03:36] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I didn't think about that
[2021-04-23 00:04:03] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: but I would have to get my parents to unlock the utensils drawer and Ive never cooked before
[2021-04-23 00:04:28] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I feel like they would interrogate me
[2021-04-23 00:04:41] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: Well even a sandwich would work and get nutrients in your body

[2021-04-23 00:06:06] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: can't touch that
[2021-04-23 00:06:16] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: without slicing it
[2021-04-23 00:06:40] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: so nobody would poison that
[2021-04-23 00:06:57] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: Well if you watched your mom cut it would that work
[2021-04-23 00:07:14] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: Then you may not get asked about utensils
[2021-04-23 00:07:40] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I want to be the only one that touches it
[2021-04-23 00:07:50] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: she could do something to it
[2021-04-23 00:07:57] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: Okay that makes sense
[2021-04-23 00:08:10] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: Yeah start with an apple

[2021-04-23 00:10:07] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: no I'm scared they are gonna either 1. put me on more meds or 2. throw me back into the loony house
[2021-04-23 00:10:46] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I'm scared of the hospital they always let my food touch even though the doctor's tell them I can't have it touch
[2021-04-23 00:10:50] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I starve there

[2021-04-23 00:11:01] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: 5 pills a day
[2021-04-23 00:11:10] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: I get how it could be scary to tell them
[2021-04-23 00:11:38] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: yea it is
[2021-04-23 00:11:45] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: Don’t be worried about how many meds I am on 6 meds overall
[2021-04-23 00:11:53] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: oh wow
[2021-04-23 00:12:09] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: No clue how many I take cause some repeat
[2021-04-23 00:12:32] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: do they teste ur kidney's?
[2021-04-23 00:12:36] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: test
[2021-04-23 00:12:43] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: that sounds dangerous
[2021-04-23 00:12:57] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: It is all safe
[2021-04-23 00:13:02] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: That's good
[2021-04-23 00:13:13] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I don't want another diagnosis
[2021-04-23 00:13:20] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: it's all labels
[2021-04-23 00:13:59] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: From what I have read there are multiple people with bpd weigh paranoia
[2021-04-23 00:14:12] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I dont have bpd
[2021-04-23 00:14:17] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I have bipolar
[2021-04-23 00:14:53] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: Oh I got confused I apologize
[2021-04-23 00:14:57] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: it's okay
[2021-04-23 00:15:01] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: I meant bipolar
[2021-04-23 00:15:11] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: oh I didn't know that
[2021-04-23 00:16:02] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: that's good to know then
[2021-04-23 00:16:29] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: so I guess the only worry would be more meds
[2021-04-23 00:17:01] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: I get how that could be scary
[2021-04-23 00:17:31] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I'm scared I am gonna have a seizur
[2021-04-23 00:17:34] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: seizure
[2021-04-23 00:17:57] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: because 2 of my meds when mixed make it possible for seizure
[2021-04-23 00:18:09] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: Oh then you definitely need to go find an adult now
[2021-04-23 00:18:27] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: That is not safe
[2021-04-23 00:18:31] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: and I'm on a seizure med for mood-stabization but it's not high enough
[2021-04-23 00:18:39] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: to control seizures
[2021-04-23 00:18:46] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I think I'm just worried
[2021-04-23 00:18:58] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: my psych knows
[2021-04-23 00:19:03] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: he went to medical school
[2021-04-23 00:19:30] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: Oh I thought you meant right now
[2021-04-23 00:19:34] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: no no no
[2021-04-23 00:19:37] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I meant just one day
[2021-04-23 00:19:40] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: randomly
[2021-04-23 00:20:13] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: that is a normal worry
[2021-04-23 00:20:26] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I always seperate my worries
[2021-04-23 00:20:34] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: but normal vs. not normal
[2021-04-23 00:21:02] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: something a normal person would worry about and something only a crazy person would worry about and I need to forget
[2021-04-23 00:21:29] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: You are not crazy
[2021-04-23 00:21:36] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: that's my point
[2021-04-23 00:21:40] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: It is okay to worry
[2021-04-23 00:21:50] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I'm able to differentiate
[2021-04-23 00:22:16] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: but not about things that u shouldnt worry about
[2021-04-23 00:23:01] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: it's weird that I don't have triggers
[2021-04-23 00:23:09] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Idk why I don't
[2021-04-23 00:23:44] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I only have one bad situational trigger but that's normal
[2021-04-23 00:24:20] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: but in a conversation nothing you say or do would ever make me uncomfortable no matter how many bad memories I have with it
[2021-04-23 00:24:47] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: It is not weird I don’t really have triggers either
[2021-04-23 00:26:07] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: oh really
[2021-04-23 00:26:08] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: It is perfectly normal
[2021-04-23 00:26:12] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: that's comforting
[2021-04-23 00:26:32] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: Triggers are something most people prefer not to get
[2021-04-23 00:26:54] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I mean yea, why would you want a trigger
[2021-04-23 00:27:07] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I have a song trigger Idk if this is too personal
[2021-04-23 00:27:18] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: but I did try to kill myself once, only once
[2021-04-23 00:27:23] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: with sleeping meds
[2021-04-23 00:28:16] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I didn't take enough and ended up forgetting almost everything except I had left my phone on one tik tok with a song going for hours
[2021-04-23 00:28:35] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I just watched it for hours
[2021-04-23 00:28:54] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: I could see how that would be triggering
[2021-04-23 00:29:26] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: yea and then my grandma found me passed out in the hall and took me to the ER
[2021-04-23 00:29:42] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: but I don't even remember that
[2021-04-23 00:29:48] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: just the tik tok song
[2021-04-23 00:30:12] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: and hallucinating that the floor was eating me
[2021-04-23 00:30:57] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: Interesting hulucinatinon I suggest you never watch beetlejuice juice then
