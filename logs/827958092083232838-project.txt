[2021-04-27 06:38:53] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: __**Safe For Work and Pingable Nicknames**__
All nicknames must be safe for work (sfw) and any inappropriate names will be changed to a temporary placeholder. Nicknames must also be searchable with a standard QWERTY keyboard. Any names that aren't easily searchable will also be changed to a temporary placeholder and you will be asked to change it.
