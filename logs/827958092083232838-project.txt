[2021-04-30 19:13:44] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: If you make the channel I will set it up
[2021-04-30 19:13:56] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: It shouldn’t need a channel should it?
[2021-04-30 19:13:59] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Put it where you want it
[2021-04-30 19:14:03] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Wait wdym
[2021-04-30 19:14:16] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: cant you just make them send it to <#826474833000661012> and then have a specified command for each channel
[2021-04-30 19:14:20] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Or smthing
[2021-04-30 19:14:22] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Like
[2021-04-30 19:14:24] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Ohh I see
[2021-04-30 19:14:26] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Yeah I can
[2021-04-30 19:14:38] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: But if they don’t use the command it’ll send to the wrong channel
[2021-04-30 19:14:43] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: So we have to trust people to read
[2021-04-30 19:15:06] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Yeah
[2021-04-30 19:15:09] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: that will be fun lol
[2021-04-30 19:15:30] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: “Why did my message go to the wrong place”

“Did you read” 

“no...”
[2021-04-30 19:15:56] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: If we have two channels so like #anon-confess-submit and <#826474833000661012> I can link it so it sends based on which channel they sent it in
[2021-04-30 19:16:45] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: yeah idk I just don’t want more unnecessary channels ya know
[2021-04-30 19:17:49] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: It’s up to you I can make the command but if you trust people to use it right lol
[2021-04-30 19:17:56] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: We can see how it works
[2021-04-30 19:18:23] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: If they use the commands wrong we can just have the channel as auto delete maybe
[2021-04-30 19:18:37] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Yeah that works
[2021-04-30 19:18:52] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: And then if it doesn’t appear then can just **read**
[2021-04-30 19:18:59] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: And maybe send a dm saying please use the right command
[2021-04-30 19:19:12] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Yeah that’s a good idea
[2021-04-30 19:19:20] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Ok cool I’ll make that tonight
[2021-04-30 19:20:48] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Thanks Michael
[2021-04-30 17:08:23] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: If we switch to using commands, do we want them to be able to be used in any channel?
[2021-04-30 17:08:29] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Or restrict to only <#826474833000661012>

[2021-04-30 17:47:25] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: They only work in <#826474833000661012> s
[2021-04-30 17:47:36] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: and will send to appropriate channels
[2021-04-30 17:48:02] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: let me know if you want the commands to change or just to add aliases for people to use
[2021-04-30 17:48:07] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: maybe like !r and !nr or something idk
