[2021-04-12 17:35:04] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: hey there
[2021-04-12 17:35:07] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: how can i help?
[2021-04-12 17:35:17] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: Hi who sent me a warning
[2021-04-12 17:35:21] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: a moderator
[2021-04-12 17:35:39] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: I get bullied by a troll and someone points to me
[2021-04-12 17:36:19] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: a moderator handled a situation in which was best, you were warned for your rude comments. if you believed a user to be a troll, ping a mod to deal with the situation
[2021-04-12 17:36:36] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: read the thread. just curious they said? he was trolling me
[2021-04-12 17:36:57] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: don't know how to do that
[2021-04-12 17:37:00] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i did read the thread thank you. in that case, please ping a moderator
[2021-04-12 17:37:54] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: also dming another user with rude insults is not okay, you will be warned for this action also.
[2021-04-12 17:38:54] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: rude insults, what was insulting about asking a passive aggressive member to stay away from me
[2021-04-12 17:40:15] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: you did not need to dm the user, let moderators deal with situations when they happen. you called them a troll, that’s hurtful. your strikes are going up to 5 strikes which mean a 12 hour mute
[2021-04-12 17:41:36] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: thank you for your cooperation.
[2021-04-12 17:44:23] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i’m going to close this ticket now. as a reminder, please do not dm users with insults. please also refrain from dming individual moderators. this will cause you to go further up the punishment ladder which will eventually result in being banned from the server.
[2021-04-12 17:44:34] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: E, made a query of me I responded, and they bullied me for my opinion. If he did not want it he should not have asked. He attacked a member and you dropped the ball.  Tell him to back off is not rude or insulting
[2021-04-12 17:45:01] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: It was telling a bully to leave me alone
[2021-04-12 17:45:18] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: but you must have a relationship with him
[2021-04-12 17:45:25] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: please do not call other users bullies. that goes against our respectful rule.
[2021-04-12 17:45:39] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: we will deal with any other situation as we see fit.
[2021-04-12 17:45:52] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: what would you call invalidating my opinions and ganging up on me
[2021-04-12 17:46:16] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: I'll just withdraw, I don't like you either
[2021-04-12 17:47:43] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: thank you for your opinion, i will be sure to take it onboard. also breaking rule 15 in this ticket means more strikes will be awarded to you. 5-7, which is a 24 hour mute after your 12 hours has ended. i look forward to talking to you again when your mute has ended
[2021-04-12 17:48:01] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: you did not here a complaint from the original member I comment to . You got a complaint from a third party but
[2021-04-12 17:48:29] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: you’re not privy to that information. please don’t assume
[2021-04-12 17:48:30] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: not. very rude of you
[2021-04-12 17:48:53] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: again, thank you for your opinion i will be closing this ticket now
[2021-04-12 17:49:13] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: goodbye. say bye to Lily and Jupiter
[2021-04-12 17:49:21] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: if you continue to insult me or any of my moderators or users, a ban will be issued.
