[2021-04-26 10:55:47] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: So sorry about messing up the previous ticket.
[2021-04-26 10:55:53] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: What can I help you with my friend?
[2021-04-26 10:56:01] (728195404122030101) freaktheloner#2458: It's fine
[2021-04-26 10:56:10] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Thank you for being so understanding.
[2021-04-26 11:02:50] (728195404122030101) freaktheloner#2458: So I have an addiction to cutting and I was clean for 4 wees but I messed up and now I'm stressed that it will get bad again. Recently I struggle to eat and it really affected my life. Also My social anxiety is getting worse and I'm scared of letting someone into my life so my behaviour can be dissapointing for my friends. And everything became so overwhelming that I have cut myself again after so long... I just think I'm not doing so well. I wish I could get a break from everything...
[2021-04-26 11:03:58] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It's totally understandable to want a break with so much going on.
[2021-04-26 11:05:15] (728195404122030101) freaktheloner#2458: I have the feeling that I am creating unnecessary problems and I just don't know what to do with it all.
[2021-04-26 11:05:26] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: I understand that feeling.
[2021-04-26 11:05:57] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: If you're feeling very worried about all these feelings, do you think it might be worth talking to a doctor?
[2021-04-26 11:06:30] (728195404122030101) freaktheloner#2458: maybe... I've got a theraphy session today
[2021-04-26 11:07:05] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Maybe you could try bringing this up?
[2021-04-26 11:07:20] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: The therapist might be able to get some support for you that could really help.
[2021-04-26 11:08:18] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Another thing I just need to check is, are you safe right now?
[2021-04-26 11:12:11] (728195404122030101) freaktheloner#2458: Am I safe? I don't know
[2021-04-26 11:12:28] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Do you have anything around that you could use to ||hurt yourself?||
[2021-04-26 11:14:10] (728195404122030101) freaktheloner#2458: yes
[2021-04-26 11:14:56] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Do you think you could try putting them away for me?
[2021-04-26 11:29:41] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Are you still there my friend?
[2021-04-26 13:11:00] (728195404122030101) freaktheloner#2458: I'm sorry
[2021-04-26 13:11:21] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: There's nothing to be sorry about my friend.
[2021-04-26 13:12:09] (728195404122030101) freaktheloner#2458: I can try
[2021-04-26 13:12:15] (728195404122030101) freaktheloner#2458: cause I did it again
[2021-04-26 13:12:29] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: That would be so amazing if you could put them away.
[2021-04-26 13:13:55] (728195404122030101) freaktheloner#2458: ok I did.
[2021-04-26 13:14:24] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: That's amazing.
[2021-04-26 13:14:35] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Do you think it's possible that you might end up doing it again?
[2021-04-26 13:15:18] (728195404122030101) freaktheloner#2458: I'm afraid yes
[2021-04-26 13:15:46] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Could you try going to a hospital to make sure you're safe?
[2021-04-26 13:16:11] (728195404122030101) freaktheloner#2458: hospital? Why?
[2021-04-26 13:16:24] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: To make sure that you are safe my friend.
[2021-04-26 13:18:27] (728195404122030101) freaktheloner#2458: My parents won't go with me to the hospital.
[2021-04-26 13:18:52] (728195404122030101) freaktheloner#2458: They will be just sad that I did it and they probably won't do anything else.
[2021-04-26 13:19:14] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Could you try calling a helpline for where you live instead?
[2021-04-26 13:24:51] (728195404122030101) freaktheloner#2458: I'll go to therapy in about 15 minutes
[2021-04-26 13:24:59] (728195404122030101) freaktheloner#2458: so I'll be safe there.
[2021-04-26 13:25:23] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Could you please make sure to tell your therapist what's happened and how you're feeling?
[2021-04-26 13:31:32] (728195404122030101) freaktheloner#2458: maybe.. i'm kinda scared.
[2021-04-26 13:31:42] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It's ok my friend.
