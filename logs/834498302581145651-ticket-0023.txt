[2021-04-21 18:41:50] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: Of course, my bad!
[2021-04-21 18:46:58] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: How old are you? 
21

What timezone are you in? 
EST

How often are you available to take tickets?
I can take tickets throughout the week, weekends are a little bit harder and definitely not Sundays. 

Do you have any known triggers and how do you manage them?
||sexual assault and child molestation|| 
They're relatively easy to avoid in day-to-day life; if they come up during conversation, I usually ask the other person to switch topics if I'm not comfortable with it at the time. If it were to come up during support, I would probably refer them to someone else if it were about ||child molestation|| but there are days where I would feel okay listening to someone if they needed to talk about ||sexual abuse|| since I have experience
