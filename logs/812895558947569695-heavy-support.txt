[2021-04-09 05:46:06] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: School is rough
[2021-04-09 09:32:45] (402850538116612097) Mikey#5199: omg its kinda crazy like school is tough normally, and somehow virtually I feel its been twice as exhausting since my relax space (home) has become my work space and it gets hard to distinguish-but just gotta keep powering through! I'm glad this server exists because kinda lets me talk with others and have more social interaction in a way. It's a little tough to talk with friends from school like just kinda feels like I bother them when messaging over distance
[2021-04-09 09:33:53] (402850538116612097) Mikey#5199: oh yea and I feel a lot of teachers are giving the same amount of work, but the teaching quality is lower, even if the teacher is good they may have not gotten a chance to adapt it to a virtual style  so the class suffers in a way
[2021-04-09 15:02:50] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: Someone who has been homeschooles and virtual most of my life here, even im burned out with college being completely online so youre not alone

[2021-04-12 06:31:41] (540371757769424921) Betsy#9202: but it is pain time instead
[2021-04-12 19:47:19] (735240227224027196) sweetenedk#9496: So this is a lil deep I guess, but I’m feeling really lonely. I’ve had a few bad experiences with friendships turning really sour and it’s made me shut myself off a lot, I barely go out (pre Covid times)  and I don’t really have any close friends that are near to me. I have one friend in another city and another in a differnt country but idk.. I feel like I could do more for myself but I lack so much confidence to join new societies in uni etc.. but it’s getting kinda hard staying like this. Idk is there any advice you guys can give? I’m embarrassed even writing this lmaoo
[2021-04-12 19:49:52] (735240227224027196) sweetenedk#9496: Sorry if this isn’t in the right place, if I need to move it somewhere else let me know
[2021-04-12 19:50:12] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: can you censor ||covid||

[2021-04-14 16:39:02] (666125620236910614) Morrow#7748: I honestly don't know what to do. I want to finish up this semester strong but I have really bad grades. All I need in Business Law and Econ to pass is a C-. Right now in Business Law I have a D+ and in Econ I have a C. All of my other classes are all Cs and C-s and one B. I just want to pass and I don't want to take any of my classes over again. I've never failed a class but it's hard when you've been out of college for 2 years, started working and now you're back in college. I got my associates degree back in 2018, went to work, and now I'm back in college. I just don't want to fail, there's only a month left for the semester and it feels like I don't have enought time
[2021-04-14 18:12:25] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: Just out of curiosity, are you a law student?
[2021-04-14 18:30:11] (666125620236910614) Morrow#7748: No. I'm in Business Administration and Marketing

[2021-04-14 18:42:49] (666125620236910614) Morrow#7748: Yeah. It's quite interesting. A lot of math though which sucks
