[2021-04-09 09:32:45] (402850538116612097) Mikey#5199: omg its kinda crazy like school is tough normally, and somehow virtually I feel its been twice as exhausting since my relax space (home) has become my work space and it gets hard to distinguish-but just gotta keep powering through! I'm glad this server exists because kinda lets me talk with others and have more social interaction in a way. It's a little tough to talk with friends from school like just kinda feels like I bother them when messaging over distance
[2021-04-09 09:33:53] (402850538116612097) Mikey#5199: oh yea and I feel a lot of teachers are giving the same amount of work, but the teaching quality is lower, even if the teacher is good they may have not gotten a chance to adapt it to a virtual style  so the class suffers in a way
