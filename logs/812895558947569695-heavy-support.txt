[2021-04-09 09:32:45] (402850538116612097) Mikey#5199: omg its kinda crazy like school is tough normally, and somehow virtually I feel its been twice as exhausting since my relax space (home) has become my work space and it gets hard to distinguish-but just gotta keep powering through! I'm glad this server exists because kinda lets me talk with others and have more social interaction in a way. It's a little tough to talk with friends from school like just kinda feels like I bother them when messaging over distance
[2021-04-09 09:33:53] (402850538116612097) Mikey#5199: oh yea and I feel a lot of teachers are giving the same amount of work, but the teaching quality is lower, even if the teacher is good they may have not gotten a chance to adapt it to a virtual style  so the class suffers in a way

I’ve had a few bad experiences with friendships turning really sour and it’s made me shut myself off a lot, I barely go out (pre Covid times)  and I don’t really have any close friends that are near to me. I have one friend in another city and another in a differnt country but idk.. I feel like I could do more for myself but I lack so much confidence to join new societies in uni etc.. but it’s getting kinda hard staying like this. Idk is there any advice you guys can give?

I just want to pass and I don't want to take any of my classes over again. I've never failed a class but it's hard when you've been out of college for 2 years, started working and now you're back in college. I got my associates degree back in 2018, went to work, and now I'm back in college. I just don't want to fail, there's only a month left for the semester and it feels like I don't have enought time

[2021-04-16 17:38:16] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: When I told my past therapist about someone online who had ||emotionally abused me|| she told me I had been naive, which I’m not sure whether that’s ||victim blaming|| or not, but the therapist was mean about other things too. I ended up switching therapists and things are a lot better now. ||Victim blaming|| (nor sure if it needs to be spoilered) is not okay, and if you are afraid of your therapist, you might want to think about trying to switch therapists if there are others available. Of course, I don’t know if your therapist has been helpful in the past, but therapy is supposed to be a safe space to talk about whatever you need to.

[2021-04-16 17:51:41] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Wow. I’m so sorry. I don’t think anybody wants that, and even if they think they want that it always ends up worse than what they want. 
Usually it’s just people wanting someone to care and then the ||abuser|| taking advantage of that

[2021-04-20 05:07:44] (724733514028941313) ToffeeNut#6343: There has been a lot going on. First off, the fire alarms went off at my apartment complex tonight. They scared me and woke up my neighbors. I feel so bad, and so much anxiety about that. I didn’t mean to set off the fire alarms, I was just cooking. I cried a lot because they wouldn’t stop chirping. They stopped chirping now that I disconnected them, but I also cried a lot because they kept chirping even after that. I didn’t know how to stop them. Since I have autism, the audio sensation of hearing them chirp causes me to panic, and I also can hear the neighbors upstairs pacing around. I feel so bad, and it is magnified by my autism. I am still crying, and I am so sorry this happened. I even got drunk to experience some happiness tonight, but the happiness was cancelled out by me having to focus on turning off the fire alarms. This didn’t have to happen

[2021-04-20 05:15:33] (724733514028941313) ToffeeNut#6343: I wanted to talk to you about me boyfriend. He and I broke up last night. I have been trying to cope with it, even though it was my fault. I have autism, so I don’t communicate with him clearly, so I caused him pain. I had been in contact with him for the last 2 months or so. He was coming over every Monday and Wednesday in between his classes. He made time for me, even though I had broken up with him twice already. We kept going back to each other because we were both sad and in bad mental states. But I feel like I led him on. It wasn’t until 2 months after he started visiting me that I expressed I had very little romantic attraction. I liked cuddling, but I did not care about him to the extent that he cared about me. I explained this to him a few times, and then yesterday, it dawned on him that he was wasting his time. He told me that I was manipulative, and a terrible person.

[2021-04-20 05:16:49] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: You can’t control others
[2021-04-20 05:16:56] (724733514028941313) ToffeeNut#6343: I don’t want that to be the case. I did welcome him into my apartment, I didn’t object. I let him come around, and I guess he assumed I would start to love him more
[2021-04-20 05:18:01] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: But you can be in love with someone emotionally with out the physical component
[2021-04-20 05:18:46] (724733514028941313) ToffeeNut#6343: I didn’t, and I feel like maybe I was manipulating him. I liked the feeling of him coming to see me during the week, and I said “I love you”. I am so sorry Dylan, I didn’t mean to do that. It just happened, and you said “I love you” first so I thought it was harmless
[2021-04-20 05:19:09] (724733514028941313) ToffeeNut#6343: Yes I did love him emotionally
[2021-04-20 05:19:17] (724733514028941313) ToffeeNut#6343: I wanted him to be there for me
[2021-04-20 05:19:23] (724733514028941313) ToffeeNut#6343: While I was depressed
[2021-04-20 05:19:51] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Yes that is allowed sometimes what is good for one part of our life isn’t for another
[2021-04-20 05:21:08] (724733514028941313) ToffeeNut#6343: I know it wasn’t good, our relationship was toxic, it felt bad most of the time. But I know he thought he wasn’t doing anything wrong, in his heart. Maybe if I was more blunt I could’ve changed him for the better
[2021-04-20 05:21:49] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Honestly it sounds like he was manipulating you
[2021-04-20 05:22:45] (724733514028941313) ToffeeNut#6343: Can you tell me how you think that? I suspect he was, I just want to hear it from someone else to confirm
[2021-04-20 05:24:05] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Like he wanted it his way or no way and when he wasn’t getting it his last straw was to berate you hoping you would change
[2021-04-20 05:24:57] (724733514028941313) ToffeeNut#6343: Yes, he was bad. I need to remind myself of that. He demanded sex a lot. And he expected me to drop everything on my days off. He was unreasonable
[2021-04-20 05:25:14] (724733514028941313) ToffeeNut#6343: I am not the only one who did wrong
[2021-04-20 05:25:20] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Yes
[2021-04-20 05:26:13] (724733514028941313) ToffeeNut#6343: Yes he was bad Amanda. I am about to fall asleep, and I feel my eyelids drooping but I want to thank you for being here tonight. It meant a lot to me
[2021-04-20 05:26:46] (724733514028941313) ToffeeNut#6343: Thank you so much
[2021-04-20 05:26:49] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Of course any time
[2021-04-20 05:27:15] (449600974365917195) Duck#1212: Good night, ToffeeNut
[2021-04-20 05:27:22] (449600974365917195) Duck#1212: Sleep well tonight
[2021-04-20 05:27:39] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Goodnight
[2021-04-21 21:13:58] (722724337421123595) rose (she/her)#0627: really struggling today with feeling like a part of me is missing. i just want a father figure in my life. i have one, however he hasn’t always been great (its a lot to explain). i crave having a father figure so much that i seek it out & i have so much guilt and shame around that. i will never have what others have. has anyone here gone thru similar?
[2021-04-21 21:14:57] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i do but with a mother figure
[2021-04-21 21:32:31] (280473340093792258) Bubbledumb#1415: I do too, and maybe because of the same things as you, I don't know
[2021-04-21 21:37:18] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: I crave a protective figure, not exactly a mother or father figure, but a emotional support, protector and guide, who protects me from other ppl and keeps me safe and warm. Someone who’s 24/7 there for me and holds me like a child.
[2021-04-21 21:47:15] (722724337421123595) rose (she/her)#0627: yeah exactly, i get it.
[2021-04-21 21:48:12] (722724337421123595) rose (she/her)#0627: yeah, it’s just a lot to explain yk?
[2021-04-21 21:49:28] (280473340093792258) Bubbledumb#1415: yeah I totally understand
[2021-04-21 21:49:42] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: I invented my own inside world and characters that fill that description to create a space where I feel loved and paid attention to. It’s that bad. I retreat there when it’s all too much or I need love and support.
[2021-04-21 21:51:39] (280473340093792258) Bubbledumb#1415: Kind of the same, but I have multiple different "worlds"
[2021-04-21 21:52:41] (280473340093792258) Bubbledumb#1415: I think it's called maladaptive daydreaming
[2021-04-21 21:52:52] (280473340093792258) Bubbledumb#1415: but I could be wrong
[2021-04-21 21:53:44] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: Maladaptive daydreaming can’t be diagnosed I think
[2021-04-21 21:55:05] (280473340093792258) Bubbledumb#1415: yeah I know, there is a all debate about this between psychologists and all, but I remember coming upon an article and I was like that's totally me
[2021-04-21 21:55:36] (280473340093792258) Bubbledumb#1415: I just like putting words on things
[2021-04-21 21:56:38] (722724337421123595) rose (she/her)#0627: i’ve had the same “made up worlds” that i escape to for so long now. it’s the only way i can stay sane.
[2021-04-21 21:56:50] (280473340093792258) Bubbledumb#1415: It's not seen as a mental illness but some psychologists and doctors want it to be seen as a mental ilness, while others don't since it's not "dangerous"
[2021-04-21 21:58:12] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: same
[2021-04-21 21:59:04] (722724337421123595) rose (she/her)#0627: yeah, i think when people start to depend on it, i think it can definitely cause some problems
[2021-04-21 22:00:00] (280473340093792258) Bubbledumb#1415: Agree on this one and you can get out of society because of this, like not talking to anyone anymore, not working and all
[2021-04-21 22:01:19] (722724337421123595) rose (she/her)#0627: for sure
[2021-04-21 22:01:24] (280473340093792258) Bubbledumb#1415: I think it should be, if not seen as a mental ilness, used by psychologists and psychiatrists to help people understand what they have
[2021-04-21 22:01:36] (722510980785111092) Trish#1000: I need this <:sleepy:799499495930462208>

[2021-04-21 22:05:54] (722510980785111092) Trish#1000: Mostly just, I inherently forget things bc adhd, and the meds help with that, but then I forget to take my med.
[2021-04-21 22:06:08] (722510980785111092) Trish#1000: How do you help yourself remember when to take them lol
[2021-04-21 22:06:17] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: do you have an app that reminds you to take your meds
[2021-04-21 22:06:47] (722510980785111092) Trish#1000: I have the reminders app on my phone, I don’t really use it much anymore.
[2021-04-21 22:07:10] (722510980785111092) Trish#1000: I could set an alarm tho, the reason I stoped using reminders is because it’s not well
[2021-04-21 22:07:27] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i have one that you have to press a button to show you took your meds
[2021-04-21 22:07:31] (722510980785111092) Trish#1000: Attention catching enough I guess you could say lol, I see it and then I swipe it away and say I’ll do it in a few

[2021-04-24 01:00:58] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: I got no idea if my boyfriend is actually less interested in me or if my anxiety with relationships is going nuts
[2021-04-24 01:01:18] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: I mean I'm p sure its the latter but I say that and then my brain is like no stupid
[2021-04-24 01:02:16] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: saying I got p f-ed up on how alone time and time separate from each other works it's also that
[2021-04-24 01:03:23] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: why are relationships so complicated <:mood:703721909321203773>
[2021-04-24 01:08:18] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: The most important thing in any relationship is open communication. You should be able to tell them how you're feeling. It isn't necessarily anyone's fault that you feel that way. Emotions are emotions. We don't control them. We can only control how we react to them.
[2021-04-24 01:10:01] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: I am in all honestly not the greatest with communication (thank you past relationships) but I'm better with talking to him
[2021-04-24 01:10:47] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: its more like I know he'll feel bad if he has even an inkling of an idea that he somehow made me feel bad and I really dont want him to feel bad
[2021-04-24 01:11:54] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: i have told him that it's easy for me to forget that yes he does love me and alone time doesn't mean he doesn't like me anymore I'm just a very needy partner so even if he spent all of his time with me I'd still feel bad if he left for like 5 seconds
[2021-04-24 01:12:50] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: which yes ik that sounds toxic which is why I tell him that just bc I'm feeling clingy doesn't mean he needs to be there next to me and yeah
[2021-04-24 01:15:12] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: so what I'm saying is idk how to tell him that I feel like he's not as interested in me anymore without making him feel bad bc 9/10 it's just my anxiety acting up bc I've also had a shit week
[2021-04-24 01:19:10] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: You say it just like that. You say it like he's a person who understand who you are, or if not is willing to do so.
[2021-04-24 01:19:57] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: I just feel like so bad about feeling this way
[2021-04-24 01:20:21] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: like he already gotta put up with my million other issues (he says it's okay and like he doesn't mind which is good but also I know its a lot of effort)
[2021-04-24 01:20:30] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: and then this is like another thing for him to worry about
[2021-04-24 01:21:09] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: No doubt, we all have our issues. You put up with his issues right? While also trying to help him improve on himself?
[2021-04-24 01:21:59] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: he doesn't have a whole lot of issues. He's got a bit of anger stuff but never used it on me
[2021-04-24 01:22:21] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: he's neurotypical so it's mostly just the normal relationship stuff for him
[2021-04-24 01:22:32] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: me on the other hand,, oh boyo
[2021-04-24 01:23:28] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Everyone has issues. Neurotypical people are no exception. Relationship issues are normal. If you have no issues that should be considered its own problem, in our opinion. A healthy relationship has a healthy amount of conflict, which prevents anyone from losing their connection with reality.
[2021-04-24 01:26:05] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: The logical part of me knows that conflict is normal and even if it causes conflict I should say something about it but the not logical part of me is deathly afraid of conflict
[2021-04-24 01:26:15] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: like I cannot even bring up the smallest of things
[2021-04-24 01:26:23] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: shoutout to my ex
[2021-04-24 01:28:15] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: I'm not trying to like discount the advice you're giving me btw like it's good stuff I'm just erm a bit of a mess
[2021-04-24 01:29:39] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: I'll probably bring it up later or tomorrow bc he's a bit swamped with homework rn which is why we aren't talking as much <:Yoshi:798783597993394227>
[2021-04-24 01:34:19] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Maybe it would be best to just tell him like 'Hey, things aren't great for me right now, and when you have time I'd like to talk about [problem(s)] in the next [timeframe]' Whatever you do, don't leave your requests open ended, because that causes a lot of anxiety in lots of people. They can't stand knowing something is wrong without knowing how wrong things are.
[2021-04-24 01:35:44] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: I'll try that
[2021-04-24 01:36:20] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: it'll take a lot of preparing for that but I trust that he's not gonna get upset with me
[2021-04-24 01:36:42] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: he already knows I have a hard time talking about stuff so it'll be not bad I hope
[2021-04-24 01:37:49] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: he also knows I have issues around relationships and all of that os yeah
[2021-04-24 01:37:54] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Yeah, he's going to feel bad, you can't get around that. That is natural. It means he cares. If a partner isn't hurt by their mistakes then they don't care about you.
[2021-04-24 01:39:02] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: I v much hate to make him feel bad
[2021-04-24 01:39:25] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: and I already fell apart earlier this week and made him worry a lot
[2021-04-24 01:39:29] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: That is good. You don't do it for your own pleasure. You are doing it because you value your relationship.
[2021-04-24 01:41:48] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: yeah and I'd rather do it when Im more calm and not in one of my moods
[2021-04-24 01:42:03] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: I've managed to not have an outburst to him yet and I plan to keep it that way
[2021-04-24 01:42:25] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: bc then I turn into a real bitch like I've shouted at people over the smallest things
[2021-04-24 01:42:45] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: That's a great plan. You should make sure that you're level headed going into the conversation. That will make things go a lot smoother.
[2021-04-24 01:43:41] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: that's the one thing I've learned and been able to stick too mostly
[2021-04-24 01:48:45] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Yes, that is an important lesson to learn.
