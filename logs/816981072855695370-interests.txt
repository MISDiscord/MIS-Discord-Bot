[2021-04-15 15:09:08] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: ah i would maybe look into the evolution of the diagnosis of hysteria since that was very influenced by societal beliefs for a while
[2021-04-15 15:09:46] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: Oh, good point!! I didn‚Äôt think of that. Thank you! I‚Äôll add it to my list.
[2021-04-15 15:10:08] (443130730478960670) Alora ü•©#7138: Well, we read a lot about the stress response system and how we are activating that much more than we are supposed to. The book *Why Don't Zebras Get Ulcers* notes that Zebras don't get ulcers, a stress related disease, because they activate their stress response for 3 minutes to escape a lion, and at the end of that 3 minutes they're either safe or they're...not. Humans however, activate our stress response for entertainment like a rollercoaster or a 30 year mortgage. This chronic or long-term activation of the stress response contributes greatly to the diseases we see most people being afflicted with later in life such as diabetes, autoimmune disease, obesity, and others.
[2021-04-15 15:11:56] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: I‚Äôll look it up! Thank you. I‚Äôm focusing on stress response in one section so this may fit there.
[2021-04-15 15:12:38] (443130730478960670) Alora ü•©#7138: We are one of the only species that can turn on our stress response using internal cues, such as distressing thoughts, rather than just environmental cues.
[2021-04-15 15:14:48] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: the only psychology books are ones for my ||childhood trauma|| class
[2021-04-15 15:39:38] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: Hmmm, trauma could be factored in. The difference in how we handle trauma today versus the past as well as the similarities. ?
[2021-04-15 15:43:01] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i mean you can definitely compare the treatment of children back now vs in the past
[2021-04-15 16:11:02] (443130730478960670) Alora ü•©#7138: Don't want to get into details here, but there is a lot more understanding of how early life events effect a child's future development. In the past, especially hunter-gatherer societies, they had their own methods of dealing with these things but it is hard to say if any of those methods were genuinely effective. One thing that has changed quite a bit is, in those societies, many mental illnesses were not considered individual failings, but a failing of the group. So there was more group support for someone who was having various issues. Obviously there's all sorts of bigotry and other things going on due to lack of understanding as well though, so hard to say if that is just romanticism of a past age.
[2021-04-15 16:59:32] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: True. You could focus on more tribal dynamics/group dynamics. Expand the evaluation of society worldwide rather than just US/UK.  Some elements of that are observable in UK or US history as well. It would just be tackling inhuman mental health facility treatments of the past somewhere in there too because your audience would likely bring that up....
[2021-04-15 17:00:31] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: Thank you guys! I think I have a good starting place.

It seems hard to find collaboraters sometimes, depending. I'll join some groups here on discord, so if this isn't the appropriate place to ask my apologies. DM though if you have music you're willing to share...with potential for spoken word/rap parts to be added. I'll post an artist on here that showcases pretty well a style I aim for. But I'll rap to about anything really

But to become a psychiatrist in the UK is _really_ difficult

[2021-04-29 21:12:17] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: You need to first do a medical degree, which is 6 years of study
Then you need to specialise into psychiatry, which can take another two years
Then you need to actually study psychiatry, which is another 4 years or so
[2021-04-29 21:12:19] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yes crocheting is amazing and is actually great since it improved your hand eye coordination and sponsors creative and patience

[2021-04-29 21:14:07] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: hey but i‚Äôm already 1/12 through

[2021-04-29 21:14:24] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Yum :)
[2021-04-29 21:14:56] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: But yeah no, on top of all of this I kinda fucked myself over even more by not taking medicine. Normally you'd take the medical entrance exams and use predicted grades assigned by teachers to apply for medicine, but since I thought my predicted grades would be shit I never took the entrance exam. Then I got nearly the best predictions possible but I don't want to reapply next year because, well, it'll just make everything more difficult
I _could_ do a course conversion from biomedical sciences to medicine, but its really tough to get accepted, they only accept the top two or three students in the entire course for transfers, and I'm just not that good lol
[2021-04-29 21:15:28] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Wait a year?
[2021-04-29 21:16:44] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: It just makes things harder because I've already applied, so it would count as reapplying, so instead of needing AAA (minimum) I'd need `A*A*A*` since all the required grades go up by one when reapplying
[2021-04-29 21:17:04] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Hmm
[2021-04-29 21:17:10] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: That‚Äôs no very fair
[2021-04-29 21:17:17] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: Also universities fucking _hate_ gap years for STEM, and medicine is competitive enough as it is
[2021-04-29 21:17:33] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: Idk I kinda get it because you are directly dealing with people's ||lives||
[2021-04-29 21:17:46] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I have a friend who got all AAA‚Äôs in her a levels but they wouldn‚Äôt let her on the course so she‚Äôs taking a year of my course and then applying
[2021-04-29 21:18:00] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: Wtf what are the entry requirements for her course?
[2021-04-29 21:18:21] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Idk but they only accept 20 at a time
[2021-04-29 21:18:40] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: Jesus
[2021-04-29 21:18:54] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: Ugh I'm so stressed about my A levels lol
[2021-04-29 21:19:02] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: If I don't get AAB I'm genuinely so fucked its not even funny
[2021-04-29 21:19:37] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: How are your predicted grades?
[2021-04-29 21:19:48] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: I mean by predicted grades are really good but they've been inflated
[2021-04-29 21:19:56] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: My predicteds are `A*A*A`
[2021-04-29 21:20:30] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: I got A*s in my UCAS exams too but year one of A levels is _way_ easier than year two ngl

[2021-04-29 21:21:53] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: Its so shit that we're still expected to do as well as previous years have
[2021-04-29 21:22:20] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: And the people last year didn't even have exams lmfao they got all the grades they needed
[2021-04-29 21:22:20] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Yeah definitely
[2021-04-29 21:22:52] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Btec waited literally until the last possible minute to release what they were doing with our exams
[2021-04-29 21:23:06] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Because I have 2 of them this year and 2 next year
[2021-04-29 21:23:37] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: Ugh
[2021-04-29 21:23:41] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: Ofc they did : )
[2021-04-29 21:24:01] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: Ricky's school gave her her timetable literally two weeks before her exams lmao
[2021-04-29 21:24:24] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I found out *today* mine has been moved to next week
[2021-04-29 21:24:29] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: And half of the exams were in one week, with subjects that had two exams having both on the same day
[2021-04-29 21:24:35] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: Holy shit
[2021-04-29 21:24:37] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: :o oh damn
[2021-04-29 21:24:44] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: Lmfao how the fuck are schools so fucking incompetent
[2021-04-29 21:24:47] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: It genuinely pisses me off
[2021-04-29 21:25:07] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: It makes me even angrier when teachers talk about how hard its been on them
[2021-04-29 21:25:42] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: 'You guys really don't appreciate how hard it is to run online lessons and sort all of these exams out' oh fuck off its not like you need to sit them or anything, you'll be fine regardless of how we do
[2021-04-29 21:26:39] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Yeah I get that because they *chose* their job, but at the same time I understand a little more because my moms a teacher and she had a hard year health-wise so I had to help with some of her work that got piled up. But it‚Äôs definitely harder for students imo
[2021-04-29 21:27:30] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: its easier for everyone when both parties are understanding of the hardships of either sides imo
[2021-04-29 21:27:56] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I have kept *one* teacher consistently since I started college
[2021-04-29 21:28:13] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: The rest all got shuffled n moved around
[2021-04-29 21:28:23] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: (Not their fault but still stressful)
[2021-04-29 21:28:34] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: jesus
[2021-04-29 21:29:58] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I started jan off with two new teachers lmao
[2021-04-29 21:48:15] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: I guess so but it just feels really shit when the teachers _could_ make things so much easier for us but they just... Aren't

Like for example, others schools are told exactly what's coming up in their exams. Literally some teachers are giving students copies of the exam papers. And other schools aren't even setting exams

[2021-04-29 21:48:49] (332501531528003584) Hushinator#4030: My school is pretty much the only school in the area which is keeping proper, full content exams in full exam conditions
