[2021-04-15 15:06:43] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: Do you have any of the theories? I‚Äôd still be interested in reading them.

[2021-04-15 15:09:08] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: ah i would maybe look into the evolution of the diagnosis of hysteria since that was very influenced by societal beliefs for a while
[2021-04-15 15:09:46] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: Oh, good point!! I didn‚Äôt think of that. Thank you! I‚Äôll add it to my list.
[2021-04-15 15:10:08] (443130730478960670) Alora ü•©#7138: Well, we read a lot about the stress response system and how we are activating that much more than we are supposed to. The book *Why Don't Zebras Get Ulcers* notes that Zebras don't get ulcers, a stress related disease, because they activate their stress response for 3 minutes to escape a lion, and at the end of that 3 minutes they're either safe or they're...not. Humans however, activate our stress response for entertainment like a rollercoaster or a 30 year mortgage. This chronic or long-term activation of the stress response contributes greatly to the diseases we see most people being afflicted with later in life such as diabetes, autoimmune disease, obesity, and others.
[2021-04-15 15:11:56] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: I‚Äôll look it up! Thank you. I‚Äôm focusing on stress response in one section so this may fit there.
[2021-04-15 15:12:38] (443130730478960670) Alora ü•©#7138: We are one of the only species that can turn on our stress response using internal cues, such as distressing thoughts, rather than just environmental cues.
[2021-04-15 15:14:48] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: the only psychology books are ones for my ||childhood trauma|| class
[2021-04-15 15:39:38] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: Hmmm, trauma could be factored in. The difference in how we handle trauma today versus the past as well as the similarities. ?
[2021-04-15 15:43:01] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i mean you can definitely compare the treatment of children back now vs in the past
[2021-04-15 16:11:02] (443130730478960670) Alora ü•©#7138: Don't want to get into details here, but there is a lot more understanding of how early life events effect a child's future development. In the past, especially hunter-gatherer societies, they had their own methods of dealing with these things but it is hard to say if any of those methods were genuinely effective. One thing that has changed quite a bit is, in those societies, many mental illnesses were not considered individual failings, but a failing of the group. So there was more group support for someone who was having various issues. Obviously there's all sorts of bigotry and other things going on due to lack of understanding as well though, so hard to say if that is just romanticism of a past age.
[2021-04-15 16:59:32] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: True. You could focus on more tribal dynamics/group dynamics. Expand the evaluation of society worldwide rather than just US/UK.  Some elements of that are observable in UK or US history as well. It would just be tackling inhuman mental health facility treatments of the past somewhere in there too because your audience would likely bring that up....
[2021-04-15 17:00:31] (635993670478331914) Bayz#3064: Thank you guys! I think I have a good starting place.
