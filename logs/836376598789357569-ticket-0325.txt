[2021-04-26 23:02:19] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: can you expand please?
[2021-04-26 23:02:26] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: on why you think we need to do more research
[2021-04-26 23:10:51] (429149430671736833) 𝒪𝒷𝑜𝓇𝑜 𝒮𝒽𝒾𝓇𝒶𝓀𝓊𝓂𝑜#8213: There’s a lot of misinformation about how systems are formed. Essentially, the commonly accepted theory by physiologists is the “theory of structural dissociation,” which basically means that everyone is born with different states dictating their needs. As we grow, these states integrate and form a whole personality. However, for those who experience trauma (until the age of 9 or so), these parts are prevented from integrating properly, essentially compartmentalizing in order to handle trauma. Amnesia is often present because one part may handle trauma that’s too much for others. 

That’s a long way say essentially that systems can only be formed as a result of trauma before the age of around 9. And there’s a lot of misinformation of people having systems without trauma, which can be invalidating those who have systems from trauma. 

I’m really not trying to be rude with any of this, and I apologize if it’s coming across that way. I really just want to help inform, since there’s so much misinformation about an already marginalized community.

Also, if you’re looking for a more in-depth read, this is a good resource.

I’m happy to field any questions you may have too, whether here or in DMs. Thanks for your patience and for listening. 🙂

[2021-04-26 23:14:48] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: we always appreciate new knowledge coming to light and we would never intentionally invalidate anyone. this being said, we get our research and knowledge from clinical websites, and we say it can be formed for many reasons as to not invalidate anyone. while we appreciate you taking your time to give us more information which we are happy to receive. our response of “ it can be formed from many ways” will not change. it is a result of trauma and this is a way of many that it is formed. but again, thank you for encouraging us to continue to lean
[2021-04-26 23:16:38] (429149430671736833) 𝒪𝒷𝑜𝓇𝑜 𝒮𝒽𝒾𝓇𝒶𝓀𝓊𝓂𝑜#8213: Understandable, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen. May I ask what other ways there are? I’m not extremely well-versed in it, and I’m open to gaining new information.
[2021-04-26 23:22:19] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: of course, while trauma is a big part, there have been studies shown that some disorders can be formed from as little as, not receiving parental love (non trauma related) developed as a coping mechanism to other early mental illness, again not caused by trauma. We cannot exclude the minority that the system hasn’t been formed by trauma, and if you look in our <#796742512664379402> section, we have resources galore about all types. the wording chosen by that moderator does stand correct
[2021-04-26 23:28:13] (429149430671736833) 𝒪𝒷𝑜𝓇𝑜 𝒮𝒽𝒾𝓇𝒶𝓀𝓊𝓂𝑜#8213: Alright, thanks for informing me. I’ll take a look at the resources. And thank you again for taking the time to talk about this. I appreciate your willingness to listen.
[2021-04-26 23:28:43] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: of course! i appreciate you bringing this to our attention!
[2021-04-26 23:28:51] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: if there isn’t anything else, may i close the ticket?
[2021-04-26 23:32:16] (429149430671736833) 𝒪𝒷𝑜𝓇𝑜 𝒮𝒽𝒾𝓇𝒶𝓀𝓊𝓂𝑜#8213: Of course. Thanks for your time.
