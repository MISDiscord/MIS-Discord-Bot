[2021-04-13 02:18:27] (816103117183123476) 𝖑𝖔𝖎𝖈(mako sys)#6610: i keep getting bullied for my mental issues. they're always telling me that i'm faking. they make fun of my scars. my mom doesn't help me neither does my dad. i feel useless. i feel like i don't belong here..
[2021-04-13 02:20:28] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: those things don’t mean that you don’t belong here. you’re in a less than ideal situation but that doesn’t mean that things won’t get better. you’ll find people who respect you and your mental health issues. and i definitely understand how tough it is when you feel like your parents don’t support you. just remember that you give meaning to your life, no one else.
