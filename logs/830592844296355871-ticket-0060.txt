[2021-04-11 00:08:32] (766796322690170932) gamersriseup383#4223: Currently I am in HS, and I just hate my school. They have caused me so much trouble in the last year alone by accusing me of cheating and getting me an offense with no evidence despite numerous evidence pointing to my innocence. I was only screwed bc some student threatened a lawsuit and they wanted to hush hush everything. My teachers have created a toxic environment where everyone is thoroughly investigated and all that matters is whatever suits the schools agenda. I am just sick of doing schoolwork but I need to to graduate my senior year. My grades have been slipping to All As and A+s to now C+s. I really don't have any inclination anymore. I have talked to other students and they feel the same. They cheat on tests and i suffer the brunt of it bc I don't. Tbh, imo, what they do is unethical, but if given the opportunity to increase a grade without getting rescinded is vital and I cant blame them. I just feel fucked everyway from this school, I am burned out. I just cant seem to soldier through. I have three exams next week and havent studied. I have no motivation left in me. I feel dead inside
[2021-04-11 00:10:55] (766796322690170932) gamersriseup383#4223: sorry if my sob story seems pathetic but everyday I just feel traumatized
[2021-04-11 00:16:02] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I’m really sorry to hear that story:( it sounds like to me what you’re saying is that the school accused you of cheating or something without having actual proof? And what do you mean by getting you an offense so you mean an offense on your school record or an offense with like the law ? I’m a little confused just on that part. And I’m also a little confused on how a teacher can personally threaten you with a lawsuit if the subject matter is if you cheated an exam or not? That’s really strange and if that’s happened to you that must be really upsetting and frustrating for you to have to deal with that ..
[2021-04-11 00:17:12] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Your story is not pathetic at all either, your feelings are valid. If anything, you’re getting cheated from your school by having the other students cheat and you get all these people thinking you cheated when you didn’t
[2021-04-11 00:19:24] (766796322690170932) gamersriseup383#4223: no they had no proof and the teacher was threatening zeros to the whole class. The real problem is that students were going to sue the school for accusing students of cheating and going to put zeros in the grade book and report it to colleges without evidence. The hs principal  didnt want a lawsuit and instead gave evryone a 50 and told kids they wont inform colleges and grade will increase if they see dedication on future exams. I also learned that my HS principal has a dark history in suing students on sexual assaults and things of that nature
[2021-04-11 00:23:00] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I think that’s probably the stupidest thing I ever heard in my entire life. To be fair, if there’s no proof either way that students cheated or not why even count that test to begin with..? Why not just write up a completely different test and do it again with supervision to show people aren’t cheating ? I feel like that’s actually insanely stupid that that’s the decision your high school came, they just screwed over everyone for no reason at all..?
[2021-04-11 00:23:39] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: And wow.. that’s actually really scary and upsetting the last part you said too about your principle
[2021-04-11 00:23:40] (766796322690170932) gamersriseup383#4223: bc they didnt want a lawsuit
[2021-04-11 00:23:48] (766796322690170932) gamersriseup383#4223: thats why]
[2021-04-11 00:23:58] (766796322690170932) gamersriseup383#4223: its all about saving the district face and money
[2021-04-11 00:25:34] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I mean this is like a side not at this point but I fail to even see what would be the actual weight in the lawsuit like who is suing who and on what grounds? Like you can’t just saw every student in the class as a teacher Bc you think they cheated
[2021-04-11 00:25:52] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: That’s actually really crazy though...
[2021-04-11 00:25:59] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: But here’s the thing too
[2021-04-11 00:26:33] (766796322690170932) gamersriseup383#4223: Well, the teacher did notice that everyone had the same answer on the test and that particular answer was wrong bc we all watched a youtube video which had the same method
[2021-04-11 00:31:58] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: But again, there’s literally no proof unless you catch everyone staring at everyone else’s papers. Trick questions exist, questions that seem to be have 2 right answers ALSO exist so it’s insane to me that someone would even considering suing students like I’m no lawyer and I don’t know about law but to me i can’t even picture that even going to a court without every lawyer in your town laughing at those teachers and throwing out the suit. 

Even with all this crazy shit happening at your school, it’s important to know that if you plan to go to college your grades are important and a representation of your work and future. I know it seems hard to kinda want to push your self in a place where stuff like this is happening but if there’s nothing you can essentially do to put a closure to thst stuff you talked about you still need to try and be motivated to go out there and do well in your classes:) classes can be hard amc challenging but if you had A grades and are slipping to Cs you can always try to work your way back up to As with either a tutor or extra studying. I know you may not like certain teachers but even asking them to stay 1-1 to help. Their jobs to help you succeed
[2021-04-11 00:38:00] (766796322690170932) gamersriseup383#4223: the problem is my teacher lies and screws students over on purpose. She actually told people to study for one thing and gives an entire test on another.
[2021-04-11 00:38:17] (766796322690170932) gamersriseup383#4223: I already took that test and I was already accepted to various colleges
[2021-04-11 00:38:30] (766796322690170932) gamersriseup383#4223: which is also wear my lack of motivation is coming from
