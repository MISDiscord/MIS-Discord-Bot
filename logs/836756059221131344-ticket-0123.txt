[2021-04-28 00:10:25] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I just want to talk about an intenal conflict im having about a friend
[2021-04-28 00:10:32] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: no triggers
[2021-04-28 00:10:52] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: hey i’m around, want to tell me what’s going on?
[2021-04-28 00:12:30] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Hey it's not a big situation I guess I just need advice really
[2021-04-28 00:13:03] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: so like Idk I guess I can't tell if my friend likes me or not
[2021-04-28 00:13:09] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: if I can put it that way
[2021-04-28 00:15:10] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: a few weeks ago I was pretty down and really just needed to talk but every time I asked if we could ft or just call cause I was not doing too good she would say she was busy talking to her bf and she does not get much time to talk to him because he has track some days
[2021-04-28 00:15:15] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: and I respect that
[2021-04-28 00:15:28] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: teenagers and relationships
[2021-04-28 00:15:53] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: but idk I guess I still felt kinda unwanted
[2021-04-28 00:18:00] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i’m sorry you’re going through this, it sounds super frustrating and lonely. people do tend to get so wrapped up a relationship, but the best thing i’ve learnt, is to be open and honest on how you’re feeling, just tell them that you feel a little left over and would like them to make more time for your friendship
[2021-04-28 00:18:39] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: and then about a week after that another friend started sitting alone during lunch and I moved across the lunch room just for one day to sit with her cause she was lonely and then when I was walking to class with friend A (one who I talked about first) her name is sarah. she got super jealous and said I was the only one who she talks with in our friend group at lunch
[2021-04-28 00:18:51] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I know but I don't want to hurt her feelings
[2021-04-28 00:18:57] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: that's what I'm worried abou
[2021-04-28 00:19:04] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: and I'm conflicted too
[2021-04-28 00:19:58] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: she has jealously issues with her bf too so idk if its just jealous issues and she just does not really care for me still
[2021-04-28 00:23:20] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: but now I'm going through shit again (meds aren't working, got bipolar disorder, psychiatrist needs to put me on new meds its been a lot) and I guess it's showing a lot more and she seems really worried and keeps asking but I just don't know if I want to talk to her. We have talked a few times deeply but it's half-assed sometimes and the other times its genuine concern. If I bring it up to her will it ruin our relationship
[2021-04-28 00:27:37] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: it’s not fair to you to feel like this, it’s having a negative impact and you deserve to have a friend that cherishes you for who you are. you’re allowed to sit with who you want for lunch too, you can have other friends, especially if she isn’t giving you the friendship you’re giving her
[2021-04-28 00:28:13] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: but then what do I do?
[2021-04-28 00:31:06] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: even if she is not here for me now, she was the one who was with me freshman year when I came to school high off my ass on pills
[2021-04-28 00:31:42] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Im just scared to lose her
[2021-04-28 00:31:46] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: there would be a void
[2021-04-28 00:32:57] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: it’s always a super scary time and high school feels like it’s the whole world, because to you it is. they were a really good friend for sticking by you, but sometimes we grow out of friendships, our friends never really leave us, they’re always there, just less close, we make new friends, new memories
[2021-04-28 00:34:40] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: That's true but then what about the memories we made together? is the relationship ending on bad terms
[2021-04-28 00:34:45] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: will she hate me
[2021-04-28 00:34:54] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I still love her
[2021-04-28 00:36:02] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: you will always have the memories, you will still be able to love her, and you may come back to each other one day, but you deserve friendship
[2021-04-28 00:45:22] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: last year she was supposed to go with me to a beach trip but my mother searched my room the night before and found vapes and alcohol bottles, I texted her about and her parents saw and decided to make her stay home. everyone thought I was sober at this point. she said we couldn't be friends anymore cause I was a bad influence and needed to get more help. I cried the whole vacation and then on the last day I got really drunk and decided to drunk text her and beg for her forgiveness and that I would never do anything like that again. she still doesn't know that was a drunk text and now that I think about it there was a reason I didn't beg her to come back when I was sober. The whole message was a lie cause I'm an asshole too, the next week I had a vacation in Orlando and smoked pot while on call with her. I'm a bitch, she is a bitch. the whole relationship since June was fabricated
[2021-04-28 00:46:17] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: that drunk text was the last time I ever drank tho
[2021-04-28 00:46:46] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I do smoke pot and now I even smoke it with her
[2021-04-28 00:51:18] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: it sounds like a super complicated friendship, like most are.
[2021-04-28 00:57:01] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: yea
[2021-04-28 19:09:33] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: hey bee prob not online but u should prob close ticket out
