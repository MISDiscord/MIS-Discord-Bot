[2021-04-27 00:31:33] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: how can we help?
[2021-04-27 00:31:47] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: I have a question about the systems
[2021-04-27 00:31:56] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: go ahead
[2021-04-27 00:33:23] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: How are you able to get to the system introduction chat? We have DID and are wondering how to properly be seen as more than just someone using a bot.
[2021-04-27 00:33:52] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: you need the plural role to access a few more channels!
[2021-04-27 00:34:21] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: ah, thank you! I think we skipped over it.
[2021-04-27 00:34:30] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: no worries at all!
[2021-04-27 00:36:05] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: wait, the plural role? I don't see it in <#808934814689918996>
[2021-04-27 00:37:37] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: it’s under system specific
[2021-04-27 00:39:14] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i’ve given you the role
[2021-04-27 00:39:17] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: you should see the channels now
[2021-04-27 00:39:40] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: Thank you :) I do apologize for my confusion.
