[2021-04-15 01:19:29] (689570204480700540) gem#2652: i just feel empty like i have no one to talk to about my problems everyones leaving me
[2021-04-15 01:20:05] (689570204480700540) gem#2652: all i can do is cry and hurt myself
[2021-04-15 01:20:08] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: hiya gem, squirrel is offline right now but i'd love to listen if you want.
[2021-04-15 01:20:26] (689570204480700540) gem#2652: oh alright
[2021-04-15 01:21:12] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: what's going on?
[2021-04-15 01:21:46] (689570204480700540) gem#2652: a lot im loosing so many friends i just feel so sad and lonely all the time
[2021-04-15 01:22:18] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: what's happening with you friends?
[2021-04-15 01:23:28] (689570204480700540) gem#2652: well i recently lost my whole friend group and it really hurt cause i told them a lot of personal stuff. now im in a group of 3 and im constantly being left out, the do so much stuff without me and i dont think how they know how much it hurts me because im already going through so much at home
[2021-04-15 01:24:23] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: do you think that you can talk to them about that? just tell them that you need some support right now because of everything that's happened recently?
[2021-04-15 01:25:57] (689570204480700540) gem#2652: i've tried but it seems like they dont really care, im always there for people but they're never there for me. the only time they talk to me is when they have problems i just feel so used
[2021-04-15 01:26:36] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: that's an awful position to be in. do you think that you could try and make other friends in the meantime that can hopefully support you?
[2021-04-15 01:27:08] (689570204480700540) gem#2652: yeah i really am trying but its kinda hard since we're in a pandemic and im still in quarantine. lets just say this year was probably the worst ive lost a lot of friends
[2021-04-15 01:27:45] (689570204480700540) gem#2652: sometimes i think of dropping them but i realize theyre the only ones i have to talk to so ill feel even worse, its like im already in so much pain because of them but if i leave them ill still be hurt
[2021-04-15 01:32:14] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah you're definitely in a tough position. maybe you can make some friends online for a bit until things open up a bit more where you live.
[2021-04-15 01:34:36] (689570204480700540) gem#2652: true, well thanks for helping. i just needed to get this off my chest, it made me smile a bit and made me feel better letting it all out. thanks:))
[2021-04-15 01:35:00] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: no problem. do you want to talk about anything else?
[2021-04-15 01:36:23] (689570204480700540) gem#2652: yeah, family issues
[2021-04-15 01:36:37] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: alright, i'm all ears
[2021-04-15 01:37:36] (689570204480700540) gem#2652: well i just wished i had a   good relationship with my dad, i just feel like such a burden and a waste of space because of him, he tells me such things that i never wish he did and i can never forget the horrible things he's told me either
[2021-04-15 01:38:35] (689570204480700540) gem#2652: the only thing thats helped me feel better is distancing myself from my family, but then i get introuble for being so anti social so i just end up crying myself to sleep
[2021-04-15 01:40:25] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i'm sorry. i know how frustrating it is to want a better relationship with your parents. you aren't defined by what your parents say about you. you're really the only person who can give yourself meaning. also in my opinion there's nothing wrong with needing space from me. do what's best for you mental health.
[2021-04-15 01:41:29] (689570204480700540) gem#2652: youre right, thanks
[2021-04-15 01:42:19] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: no problem. you come first.
[2021-04-15 01:43:26] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: you can talk about anything else you want
[2021-04-15 01:43:33] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i'm here to listen to anything you want to talk about
[2021-04-15 01:43:45] (689570204480700540) gem#2652: well yeah that's pretty much it
[2021-04-15 01:44:03] (689570204480700540) gem#2652: and once again thank you
[2021-04-15 01:45:22] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: no problem. you can open a ticket any time you wanna talk.
[2021-04-15 01:45:33] (689570204480700540) gem#2652: alright ^^
