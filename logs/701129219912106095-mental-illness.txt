[2021-04-11 17:11:56] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Is it just me or does anybody feel like their mental illness affects thinking outside of the realms of their illness? Or is that just me?
I feel as if I have moments that make me seem "visibly mentally ill", but for the most part, generalized anxiety disorder has a reputation of being very hidden.

Idk maybe this is a ramble at this point ^^;
[2021-04-11 17:12:44] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: And I only mention GAD because I feel as if that is the disorder that affects how I interact with the world for the most part
[2021-04-11 17:18:24] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: honestly my biggest issue is that i constantly forget that mental illnesses are disorders so i always get mad at myself when i feel like i'm not functioning "normally"
[2021-04-11 17:19:13] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: but yeah definitely feel like it affects all aspects of my lif
[2021-04-11 17:19:55] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I can 100% understand that ^^; and I'm glad I'm not the only one
[2021-04-11 17:20:43] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I get angry at myself at times because of this misconception that I can control it/I caused it or something, haha. But I can totally relate
[2021-04-11 17:22:48] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Of course trauma affects all aspects of functioning but I do believe my GAD/mental disorders is much more of a game player in interactions than some mental health professionals think, but there's still so much research to be done, soü§∑
[2021-04-11 17:23:52] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i mean they are disorders because they affect your normal daily ability to function
[2021-04-11 17:24:43] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: oh yeah of course! But in my mind I could have "prevented" it or something lol. My logic üòê
[2021-04-11 17:24:56] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: no worries though I know this isn't true
[2021-04-11 17:26:08] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: Just giving my experience here: my mental illness affects every area of my life sadly and if I‚Äôm in a bad day can really paralyze me. <:Thinking:820239274670424104>
[2021-04-11 17:27:27] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Right???? I'm glad I'm not alone in feeling this way, it can really be a massive influence
[2021-04-11 17:27:53] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Also, sending hearts for those times <:HeartGivingPengu:798783648086229022>
[2021-04-11 17:28:13] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: it can sadly.
[2021-04-11 17:29:17] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Exactly, exactly.
[2021-04-11 17:30:15] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: And then in my case specifically, I feel as if people aren't exactly caring for those visibly ill with a sickness they can't see, so it's like you've gotta hide yourself all day just to keep composed
[2021-04-11 17:31:00] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: I always pretend I‚Äôm all fine when I‚Äôm going insane inside
[2021-04-11 17:31:02] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: can you censor the part regarding ||eating||
[2021-04-11 17:31:08] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: yeah sure
[2021-04-11 17:31:10] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: sorry
[2021-04-11 17:32:45] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: But yeah it's intense XD glad I know now that I'm not alone in that. :>
[2021-04-11 17:32:48] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: sometimes i honestly just wish that someone would just sit with me and tell me everything is gonna be ok but idk if that's just a result of trauma
[2021-04-11 17:32:59] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: oh I totally understand that
[2021-04-11 17:34:11] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: same, I just want someone to hold me and tell me they are gonna always be here for me and that they love me no matter what.
[2021-04-11 17:34:22] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Personally I wish people would be a bit more compassionate with people with poor or different mental health than them
[2021-04-11 17:35:32] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah agreed. i've had some bad experiences with people rude regarding mental health.
[2021-04-11 17:36:09] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: absolutely
[2021-04-11 17:38:38] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I have had to totally disregard my own mental health at the cost of seeming 100% "sane" to others, and I will admit that that has totally blown up in my face ^^;
[2021-04-11 17:39:28] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Because now I can't pretend that there's nothing going on, even though I've had full-on ||breakdowns|| in front of people before, and I just ||get yelled at about it||
[2021-04-11 17:41:11] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: my ex friends got mad at me that my ||depressive episode|| was going on so long and so they started calling me ||manipulative and a psycho|| behind my back. the ||psycho|| part was referring to the fact that i needed to take ||medications for my disorders||
[2021-04-11 17:42:02] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: See, that's so disrespectful. I'm glad that they're ex-friends now, but you shouldn't have had to go through that in the first place
[2021-04-11 17:42:07] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: super ignorant
[2021-04-11 17:43:29] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah it just reminded me how rude people are
[2021-04-11 17:43:35] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Definitely.
[2021-04-11 17:45:49] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: It's super sad, I think. But thankfully there are people who understand and stuff. Tbh the stigma is one of the biggest influences stopping me from taking care of myself
[2021-04-11 17:46:07] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I take care of myself of course, but could I do more? Definitely
[2021-04-11 17:47:19] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: when I‚Äôm having a ||depressive episode ||my mom calls me ||lazy|| and my dad says I‚Äôm being ||ridiculous|| when I ||cry||. *sighs* So much stigma.
[2021-04-11 17:47:38] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Yep yeeeeeeeeeeeeep I TOTALLY get what you mean
[2021-04-11 17:47:39] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: same with my parents
[2021-04-11 17:47:45] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Same, can relate
[2021-04-11 17:47:49] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: you're definitely not alone in that
[2021-04-11 17:48:16] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: My dad has told me that I do things slowly out of spite
[2021-04-11 17:48:49] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Like, where does this come from? Idk, they need something to explain it because they don't experience it, I guess.
[2021-04-11 17:51:45] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: But, I'm glad that we can kind of relate and be supportive of one another about this stuff.
[2021-04-13 17:52:10] (632334326209445928) Tyler, The Creator#1279: i'm sad

I‚Äôm so tired of binging food because of my stress. So this is my solution. I know it‚Äôs not good but I guess it‚Äôs better than ||cutting||...
