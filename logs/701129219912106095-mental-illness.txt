[2021-04-11 17:11:56] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Is it just me or does anybody feel like their mental illness affects thinking outside of the realms of their illness? Or is that just me?
I feel as if I have moments that make me seem "visibly mentally ill", but for the most part, generalized anxiety disorder has a reputation of being very hidden.

Idk maybe this is a ramble at this point ^^;
[2021-04-11 17:12:44] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: And I only mention GAD because I feel as if that is the disorder that affects how I interact with the world for the most part
[2021-04-11 17:18:24] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: honestly my biggest issue is that i constantly forget that mental illnesses are disorders so i always get mad at myself when i feel like i'm not functioning "normally"
[2021-04-11 17:19:13] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: but yeah definitely feel like it affects all aspects of my lif
[2021-04-11 17:19:55] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I can 100% understand that ^^; and I'm glad I'm not the only one
[2021-04-11 17:20:43] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I get angry at myself at times because of this misconception that I can control it/I caused it or something, haha. But I can totally relate
[2021-04-11 17:22:48] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Of course trauma affects all aspects of functioning but I do believe my GAD/mental disorders is much more of a game player in interactions than some mental health professionals think, but there's still so much research to be done, so🤷
[2021-04-11 17:23:52] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i mean they are disorders because they affect your normal daily ability to function
[2021-04-11 17:24:43] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: oh yeah of course! But in my mind I could have "prevented" it or something lol. My logic 😐
[2021-04-11 17:24:56] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: no worries though I know this isn't true
[2021-04-11 17:26:08] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: Just giving my experience here: my mental illness affects every area of my life sadly and if I’m in a bad day can really paralyze me. <:Thinking:820239274670424104>
[2021-04-11 17:27:27] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Right???? I'm glad I'm not alone in feeling this way, it can really be a massive influence
[2021-04-11 17:27:53] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Also, sending hearts for those times <:HeartGivingPengu:798783648086229022>
[2021-04-11 17:28:13] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: it can sadly.
[2021-04-11 17:29:17] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Exactly, exactly.
[2021-04-11 17:30:15] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: And then in my case specifically, I feel as if people aren't exactly caring for those visibly ill with a sickness they can't see, so it's like you've gotta hide yourself all day just to keep composed
[2021-04-11 17:31:00] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: I always pretend I’m all fine when I’m going insane inside
[2021-04-11 17:31:02] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: can you censor the part regarding ||eating||
[2021-04-11 17:31:08] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: yeah sure
[2021-04-11 17:31:10] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: sorry
[2021-04-11 17:32:45] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: But yeah it's intense XD glad I know now that I'm not alone in that. :>
[2021-04-11 17:32:48] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: sometimes i honestly just wish that someone would just sit with me and tell me everything is gonna be ok but idk if that's just a result of trauma
[2021-04-11 17:32:59] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: oh I totally understand that
[2021-04-11 17:34:11] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: same, I just want someone to hold me and tell me they are gonna always be here for me and that they love me no matter what.
[2021-04-11 17:34:22] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Personally I wish people would be a bit more compassionate with people with poor or different mental health than them
[2021-04-11 17:35:32] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah agreed. i've had some bad experiences with people rude regarding mental health.
[2021-04-11 17:36:09] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: absolutely
[2021-04-11 17:38:38] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I have had to totally disregard my own mental health at the cost of seeming 100% "sane" to others, and I will admit that that has totally blown up in my face ^^;
[2021-04-11 17:39:28] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Because now I can't pretend that there's nothing going on, even though I've had full-on ||breakdowns|| in front of people before, and I just ||get yelled at about it||
[2021-04-11 17:41:11] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: my ex friends got mad at me that my ||depressive episode|| was going on so long and so they started calling me ||manipulative and a psycho|| behind my back. the ||psycho|| part was referring to the fact that i needed to take ||medications for my disorders||
[2021-04-11 17:42:02] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: See, that's so disrespectful. I'm glad that they're ex-friends now, but you shouldn't have had to go through that in the first place
[2021-04-11 17:42:07] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: super ignorant
[2021-04-11 17:43:29] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah it just reminded me how rude people are
[2021-04-11 17:43:35] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Definitely.
[2021-04-11 17:45:49] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: It's super sad, I think. But thankfully there are people who understand and stuff. Tbh the stigma is one of the biggest influences stopping me from taking care of myself
[2021-04-11 17:46:07] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I take care of myself of course, but could I do more? Definitely
[2021-04-11 17:47:19] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: when I’m having a ||depressive episode ||my mom calls me ||lazy|| and my dad says I’m being ||ridiculous|| when I ||cry||. *sighs* So much stigma.
[2021-04-11 17:47:38] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Yep yeeeeeeeeeeeeep I TOTALLY get what you mean

[2021-04-11 17:47:49] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: you're definitely not alone in that
[2021-04-11 17:48:16] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: My dad has told me that I do things slowly out of spite
[2021-04-11 17:48:49] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Like, where does this come from? Idk, they need something to explain it because they don't experience it, I guess.
[2021-04-11 17:51:45] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: But, I'm glad that we can kind of relate and be supportive of one another about this stuff.

[2021-04-17 19:43:31] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: LIKE a loud noise happened and now I'm just agitated
[2021-04-17 19:43:57] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Well, it hasn't messed up my entire day, I'm exaggerating. But it was still so annoying 😐
[2021-04-17 19:44:27] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: *sigh* It's so weird. ^^;
[2021-04-17 19:49:03] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: It’s not weird. Loud noises startle me too, specially noises like a train passing by and it makes me really stressed and agitated.
[2021-04-17 19:49:50] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Seriously?! I'm so glad I'm not the only one. It's like loud noises physically hurt even if they aren't loud enough to actually hurt your ears
[2021-04-17 19:50:22] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: A spray can fell over on the floor so it was much smaller but *still*

[2021-04-18 21:11:19] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: ~~I wanted to contribute but looking at this channel makes me think I write here too much lol~~^^;

Anyway, this is an open letter to both the supportive server and people who helped me get professional help. The other day when I was having a lot of symptoms and couldn't really differentiate myself from my illness, my friend basically was like, "you don't sound like yourself at all. Are you ||using drugs?||" and thinking about it now is *extremely* eye-opening. At the time I thought it was just silly, but thinking critically, that just goes to show you how this sickness *is sickness* even if I have trouble validating and taking care of myself sometimes. This was a little rambley but thought I should say something interesting!
[2021-04-19 19:18:46] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: it’s really cute how i can completely break down and be dancing to a random ed sheeran song 10 minutes later
[2021-04-19 19:19:36] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: and before i get judged for the ed sheeran, my spotify is on shuffle
[2021-04-19 19:24:14] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Hey not all Ed Sheeran is cringe
[2021-04-19 19:24:36] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: But also thats very relatable
[2021-04-19 19:31:20] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I was going to actually ask here about something sort of similar. I don’t want to diagnose myself for obvious reasons, and I’m not looking for a diagnosis, but I wanted to ask about ||mood swings||, if that’s the right term. 

I don’t know much about them, but sometimes I’ll be really *really* depressed and then I’ll think something or I’ll wake up the next morning and then be super happy for a while until I’m back to depressed. I don’t know if that’s even what ||mood swings|| are, I just know with me sometimes it’s caused by something happening and sometimes it’s caused by random thoughts and sometimes it’s caused by seemingly nothing at all.  I think this started about 6 years ago, but at the time I ||wasn’t eating||, so I thought that was a temporary thing. 

Again, I’m not looking for a diagnosis, but I do want to know if I should talk to my psychiatrist about this tomorrow because I am diagnosed with depression but I do have happy amounts of time. Like how I was a happy for 3 weeks before that ended on Saturday. I don’t know how to explain.
[2021-04-19 19:39:35] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: I definitely think you should. I didn’t tell my psychiatrist about it until recently and i had to switch meds cause of it.
[2021-04-19 19:41:22] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Ok. I will. I’m just nervous because when I told the psychiatrist about how I got happier she probably thinks the meds are working  idk it’s hard oof
[2021-04-19 19:45:24] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: but it's being super happy
[2021-04-19 19:45:43] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: you should emphasize that it changes frequently
[2021-04-19 19:46:56] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I should keel better track of it, sometimes it changes throughout the day (a few hours maybe) and I don’t know what’s normal
[2021-04-19 19:47:04] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: It just depends
[2021-04-19 19:49:05] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i have the same thing so you're not alone
[2021-04-19 19:49:54] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Thanks. I know being happy all the time is unrealistic but I had it for 3 weeks and now I really really miss it
[2021-04-19 19:55:15] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: Don’t mean to intrude but I can deff relate. I can be super happy for a few hours and then I end up very depressed out of the blue or sometimes caused by small comments others make or if a bad event happens. Sometimes it’s minutes, like happy-sad-happy-sad at all once.
[2021-04-19 19:55:52] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Yeah...emotions are difficult 
And you’re not intruding at all
[2021-04-19 19:57:09] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: I’m glad.
[2021-04-19 20:00:08] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: I get really intense ||mood swings || if I feel like that certain person doesn’t like me anymore or hates me, usually small comments like “I’m busy” or “I don’t want to talk right now” and I end up crying for days. After the ||depression||, I get furious at that person and I want to ditch them but then they talk again to me so I go to being happy again. Even pictures of being with friends is enough to make me feel like I’m not being appreciated and that that person doesn’t really care about me.
[2021-04-19 20:00:51] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Oh the “I don’t wanna talk right now” one makes me really upset too
[2021-04-19 20:04:00] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: Yeah, deff. I always wondered if this is how a “normal” person would react to such things or if I’m just too sensitive. I also tend to have ||codependent|| tendencies.
[2021-04-19 20:04:38] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah i have a really bad fear of abandonment so the slightest change in tone causes me to spiral
[2021-04-19 20:07:01] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: And when they don’t reply to you after a few hours and you are like “Why aren’t they replying to me, do they hate me” and then I go like to “they suck anyway, they were super toxic and mean so might as well ditch them since they prefer to be with other people” and then they reply and they just went to go somewhere and I don’t know what to do anymore smh.
[2021-04-19 20:07:02] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I used to have bad abandonment fears because of certain things with certain people, now I just think about irl people too much
[2021-04-19 20:08:27] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah it sucks
[2021-04-19 20:09:46] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I wish I could be emotionally independent I guess. Sometimes (when I’m super happy) I am but I’m still thinking about certain people then other times when I’m sad it’s awful being alone ?? Idk
[2021-04-19 20:10:30] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah i'm very emotionally dependent on people
[2021-04-19 20:11:38] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: My self worth is dependent on what others think of me, specially some very close people, so any good opinion they have gives me extreme happiness and any criticism makes me feel like a ||worthless || waste of space and that I’m a horrible and evil person.
[2021-04-19 20:12:36] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Why’s this me tho (sorry I’m not trying to be funny I’m just relating to it too much)
[2021-04-19 20:13:13] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: No worries. It’s all good.
[2021-04-19 20:13:47] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: same
[2021-04-19 20:17:45] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: I guess all I really want is someone to tell me that they see me and love me and that they are gonna always be there for me and prioritize me over everything else. I want to feel like I’m someone’s top priority for once. Ik it’s unhealthy but I crave for a huge amount of attention, praise and love that most people can’t give me, and when they can’t give me it hurts like ||hell||.
[2021-04-19 21:10:20] (707013290928111718) Gobernador toot#4742: one time i ||died||
[2021-04-20 16:43:51] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I’m pretty mad at my psychiatrist (I just had my appointment)
She didn’t really let me talk about the ||mood swings|| or whatever they are I didn’t even get a chance to tell her exactly how ||depressed|| I have been the past few days. She said it was good that I’ve been super happy for those three weeks and said that the drop in my mood probably “seems bigger than it is” and I disagree with her because ||I’m literally wanting to kill myself|| ugh why can’t I just stay happy when I’m happy??? I know people like me better when I’m happy but ||I still deserve to die|| 
Sorry this turned from a mental illness discussion into a full blown rant. I’m sorry. The psychiatrist also said a lot of my issues were “normal” and talked about ||church related stuff such as the “hand of God bringing her back to church” and implied that the same will happen to me (I used to be religious so I get where she’s coming from, but now I’m just scared)|| 
I feel terrible 😞
[2021-04-20 16:45:17] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: hey weehehe. i’m so sorry your psychiatrist didn’t properly listen to you about your mental health. i had the same issue with mine. so you’re not alone. <:zzAsterHeartHug:816901221653807146> please stay safe and we all love you

[2021-04-20 18:07:49] (130075894931914752) kristianuɐıʇsıɹʞ#0707: I  used to see shadows. one time when i was trying to sleep i saw someone standing next to my bed

[2021-04-20 18:12:38] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We have audio hallucinations from time to time. Usually sounds like someone yelling at us, or sometimes we hear our name or footsteps.
[2021-04-20 18:13:23] (130075894931914752) kristianuɐıʇsıɹʞ#0707: It was kinda like two voices that blurred out my inner voice

[2021-04-20 18:18:06] (130075894931914752) kristianuɐıʇsıɹʞ#0707: Yeah that is an visual hallucination. everyone can get hallucinations without it being schizophrenia
[2021-04-20 18:18:38] (130075894931914752) kristianuɐıʇsıɹʞ#0707: Voices are also normal for people without schizophrenia
[2021-04-20 18:19:48] (130075894931914752) kristianuɐıʇsıɹʞ#0707: Those things are called positive symptoms. but what makes a psychologist think you are schizophrenic is if you have negative symptoms
[2021-04-20 18:19:59] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: I did for a few months (a few years ago) have a voice in my head that constantly talked to me. Never rly understood what that was about.

[2021-04-20 18:31:51] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: About the whole negative symptom thing.

I don’t have an official diagnoses yet but I’m started to feel like a bucket of disorders being dragged around. Like I know I get along but barely. :/
[2021-04-21 04:16:28] (722510980785111092) Trish#1000: Perfectly fine, I have plushies and some fidget items. They work well for me

[2021-04-21 11:43:15] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Are you currently seeing a professional?
[2021-04-21 13:13:44] (461976868535664651) Cross#9965: Did somebody ping me sorry I didn't see I'm currently in therapy right now..

[2021-04-21 17:09:13] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: I wouldn't stop it tbh
[2021-04-21 17:09:36] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: And if you're likely to hurt the pets I think it's best that you leave them w a friend for a while
[2021-04-21 17:09:52] (807717412099063889) cloudysaturn#8355: I guess
[2021-04-21 17:13:28] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: What do you have?
[2021-04-21 21:43:12] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Do you guys have tips for sleeping at a regular time? And do you guys think writing down a sleep routine is weird? I wanted to add it to my planner because I've been having trouble sleeping on time but somebody told me that it didn't make sense
[2021-04-21 22:33:56] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Writing it makes a ton of sense. Sometimes a visual can be really helpful.
[2021-04-21 22:39:02] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Thanks! Yeah I'm a very visual person  and writing things down helps me remember them, so It thought it might help

[2021-04-22 00:11:42] (807717412099063889) cloudysaturn#8355: I'm especially aggressive towards the dogs, because they bark so much, and I just can't control it
[2021-04-22 00:31:14] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Are they your parents or yours?
[2021-04-22 00:39:59] (807717412099063889) cloudysaturn#8355: They're the family pets
[2021-04-22 00:45:14] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Are you able to distance yourself from them?
