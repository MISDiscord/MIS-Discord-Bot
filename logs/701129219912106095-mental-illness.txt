[2021-04-11 17:11:56] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Is it just me or does anybody feel like their mental illness affects thinking outside of the realms of their illness? Or is that just me?
I feel as if I have moments that make me seem "visibly mentally ill", but for the most part, generalized anxiety disorder has a reputation of being very hidden.

Idk maybe this is a ramble at this point ^^;
[2021-04-11 17:12:44] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: And I only mention GAD because I feel as if that is the disorder that affects how I interact with the world for the most part
[2021-04-11 17:18:24] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: honestly my biggest issue is that i constantly forget that mental illnesses are disorders so i always get mad at myself when i feel like i'm not functioning "normally"
[2021-04-11 17:19:13] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: but yeah definitely feel like it affects all aspects of my lif
[2021-04-11 17:19:55] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I can 100% understand that ^^; and I'm glad I'm not the only one
[2021-04-11 17:20:43] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I get angry at myself at times because of this misconception that I can control it/I caused it or something, haha. But I can totally relate
[2021-04-11 17:22:48] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Of course trauma affects all aspects of functioning but I do believe my GAD/mental disorders is much more of a game player in interactions than some mental health professionals think, but there's still so much research to be done, soü§∑
[2021-04-11 17:23:52] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i mean they are disorders because they affect your normal daily ability to function
[2021-04-11 17:24:43] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: oh yeah of course! But in my mind I could have "prevented" it or something lol. My logic üòê
[2021-04-11 17:24:56] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: no worries though I know this isn't true
[2021-04-11 17:26:08] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: Just giving my experience here: my mental illness affects every area of my life sadly and if I‚Äôm in a bad day can really paralyze me. <:Thinking:820239274670424104>
[2021-04-11 17:27:27] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Right???? I'm glad I'm not alone in feeling this way, it can really be a massive influence
[2021-04-11 17:27:53] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Also, sending hearts for those times <:HeartGivingPengu:798783648086229022>
[2021-04-11 17:28:13] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: it can sadly.
[2021-04-11 17:29:17] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Exactly, exactly.
[2021-04-11 17:30:15] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: And then in my case specifically, I feel as if people aren't exactly caring for those visibly ill with a sickness they can't see, so it's like you've gotta hide yourself all day just to keep composed
[2021-04-11 17:31:00] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: I always pretend I‚Äôm all fine when I‚Äôm going insane inside
[2021-04-11 17:31:02] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: can you censor the part regarding ||eating||
[2021-04-11 17:31:08] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: yeah sure
[2021-04-11 17:31:10] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: sorry
[2021-04-11 17:32:45] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: But yeah it's intense XD glad I know now that I'm not alone in that. :>
[2021-04-11 17:32:48] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: sometimes i honestly just wish that someone would just sit with me and tell me everything is gonna be ok but idk if that's just a result of trauma
[2021-04-11 17:32:59] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: oh I totally understand that
[2021-04-11 17:34:11] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: same, I just want someone to hold me and tell me they are gonna always be here for me and that they love me no matter what.
[2021-04-11 17:34:22] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Personally I wish people would be a bit more compassionate with people with poor or different mental health than them
[2021-04-11 17:35:32] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah agreed. i've had some bad experiences with people rude regarding mental health.
[2021-04-11 17:36:09] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: absolutely
[2021-04-11 17:38:38] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I have had to totally disregard my own mental health at the cost of seeming 100% "sane" to others, and I will admit that that has totally blown up in my face ^^;
[2021-04-11 17:39:28] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Because now I can't pretend that there's nothing going on, even though I've had full-on ||breakdowns|| in front of people before, and I just ||get yelled at about it||
[2021-04-11 17:41:11] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: my ex friends got mad at me that my ||depressive episode|| was going on so long and so they started calling me ||manipulative and a psycho|| behind my back. the ||psycho|| part was referring to the fact that i needed to take ||medications for my disorders||
[2021-04-11 17:42:02] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: See, that's so disrespectful. I'm glad that they're ex-friends now, but you shouldn't have had to go through that in the first place
[2021-04-11 17:42:07] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: super ignorant
[2021-04-11 17:43:29] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah it just reminded me how rude people are
[2021-04-11 17:43:35] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Definitely.
[2021-04-11 17:45:49] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: It's super sad, I think. But thankfully there are people who understand and stuff. Tbh the stigma is one of the biggest influences stopping me from taking care of myself
[2021-04-11 17:46:07] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I take care of myself of course, but could I do more? Definitely
[2021-04-11 17:47:19] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: when I‚Äôm having a ||depressive episode ||my mom calls me ||lazy|| and my dad says I‚Äôm being ||ridiculous|| when I ||cry||. *sighs* So much stigma.
[2021-04-11 17:47:38] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Yep yeeeeeeeeeeeeep I TOTALLY get what you mean

[2021-04-11 17:47:45] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Same, can relate
[2021-04-11 17:47:49] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: you're definitely not alone in that
[2021-04-11 17:48:16] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: My dad has told me that I do things slowly out of spite
[2021-04-11 17:48:49] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Like, where does this come from? Idk, they need something to explain it because they don't experience it, I guess.
[2021-04-11 17:51:45] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: But, I'm glad that we can kind of relate and be supportive of one another about this stuff.

[2021-04-17 19:43:31] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: LIKE a loud noise happened and now I'm just agitated

[2021-04-17 19:44:27] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: *sigh* It's so weird. ^^;

[2021-04-18 21:11:19] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: ~~I wanted to contribute but looking at this channel makes me think I write here too much lol~~^^;

Anyway, this is an open letter to both the supportive server and people who helped me get professional help. The other day when I was having a lot of symptoms and couldn't really differentiate myself from my illness, my friend basically was like, "you don't sound like yourself at all. Are you ||using drugs?||" and thinking about it now is *extremely* eye-opening. At the time I thought it was just silly, but thinking critically, that just goes to show you how this sickness *is sickness* even if I have trouble validating and taking care of myself sometimes. This was a little rambley but thought I should say something interesting!
[2021-04-19 19:18:46] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: it‚Äôs really cute how i can completely break down and be dancing to a random ed sheeran song 10 minutes later
[2021-04-19 19:19:36] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: and before i get judged for the ed sheeran, my spotify is on shuffle

[2021-04-19 19:24:36] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: But also thats very relatable
[2021-04-19 19:31:20] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I was going to actually ask here about something sort of similar. I don‚Äôt want to diagnose myself for obvious reasons, and I‚Äôm not looking for a diagnosis, but I wanted to ask about ||mood swings||, if that‚Äôs the right term. 

I don‚Äôt know much about them, but sometimes I‚Äôll be really *really* depressed and then I‚Äôll think something or I‚Äôll wake up the next morning and then be super happy for a while until I‚Äôm back to depressed. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs even what ||mood swings|| are, I just know with me sometimes it‚Äôs caused by something happening and sometimes it‚Äôs caused by random thoughts and sometimes it‚Äôs caused by seemingly nothing at all.  I think this started about 6 years ago, but at the time I ||wasn‚Äôt eating||, so I thought that was a temporary thing. 

Again, I‚Äôm not looking for a diagnosis, but I do want to know if I should talk to my psychiatrist about this tomorrow because I am diagnosed with depression but I do have happy amounts of time. Like how I was a happy for 3 weeks before that ended on Saturday. I don‚Äôt know how to explain.
[2021-04-19 19:39:35] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: I definitely think you should. I didn‚Äôt tell my psychiatrist about it until recently and i had to switch meds cause of it.
[2021-04-19 19:41:22] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Ok. I will. I‚Äôm just nervous because when I told the psychiatrist about how I got happier she probably thinks the meds are working  idk it‚Äôs hard oof
[2021-04-19 19:45:24] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: but it's being super happy
[2021-04-19 19:45:43] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: you should emphasize that it changes frequently
[2021-04-19 19:46:56] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I should keel better track of it, sometimes it changes throughout the day (a few hours maybe) and I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs normal
[2021-04-19 19:47:04] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: It just depends
[2021-04-19 19:49:05] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i have the same thing so you're not alone
[2021-04-19 19:49:54] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Thanks. I know being happy all the time is unrealistic but I had it for 3 weeks and now I really really miss it
[2021-04-19 19:55:15] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: Don‚Äôt mean to intrude but I can deff relate. I can be super happy for a few hours and then I end up very depressed out of the blue or sometimes caused by small comments others make or if a bad event happens. Sometimes it‚Äôs minutes, like happy-sad-happy-sad at all once.
[2021-04-19 19:55:52] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Yeah...emotions are difficult 
And you‚Äôre not intruding at all
[2021-04-19 19:57:09] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: I‚Äôm glad.
[2021-04-19 20:00:08] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: I get really intense ||mood swings || if I feel like that certain person doesn‚Äôt like me anymore or hates me, usually small comments like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm busy‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk right now‚Äù and I end up crying for days. After the ||depression||, I get furious at that person and I want to ditch them but then they talk again to me so I go to being happy again. Even pictures of being with friends is enough to make me feel like I‚Äôm not being appreciated and that that person doesn‚Äôt really care about me.
[2021-04-19 20:00:51] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Oh the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna talk right now‚Äù one makes me really upset too
[2021-04-19 20:04:00] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: Yeah, deff. I always wondered if this is how a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person would react to such things or if I‚Äôm just too sensitive. I also tend to have ||codependent|| tendencies.
[2021-04-19 20:04:38] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah i have a really bad fear of abandonment so the slightest change in tone causes me to spiral
[2021-04-19 20:07:01] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: And when they don‚Äôt reply to you after a few hours and you are like ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt they replying to me, do they hate me‚Äù and then I go like to ‚Äúthey suck anyway, they were super toxic and mean so might as well ditch them since they prefer to be with other people‚Äù and then they reply and they just went to go somewhere and I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore smh.
[2021-04-19 20:07:02] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I used to have bad abandonment fears because of certain things with certain people, now I just think about irl people too much
[2021-04-19 20:08:27] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah it sucks
[2021-04-19 20:09:46] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I wish I could be emotionally independent I guess. Sometimes (when I‚Äôm super happy) I am but I‚Äôm still thinking about certain people then other times when I‚Äôm sad it‚Äôs awful being alone ?? Idk
[2021-04-19 20:10:30] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah i'm very emotionally dependent on people
[2021-04-19 20:11:38] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: My self worth is dependent on what others think of me, specially some very close people, so any good opinion they have gives me extreme happiness and any criticism makes me feel like a ||worthless || waste of space and that I‚Äôm a horrible and evil person.
[2021-04-19 20:12:36] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Why‚Äôs this me tho (sorry I‚Äôm not trying to be funny I‚Äôm just relating to it too much)
[2021-04-19 20:13:13] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: No worries. It‚Äôs all good.
[2021-04-19 20:13:47] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: same
[2021-04-19 20:17:45] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: I guess all I really want is someone to tell me that they see me and love me and that they are gonna always be there for me and prioritize me over everything else. I want to feel like I‚Äôm someone‚Äôs top priority for once. Ik it‚Äôs unhealthy but I crave for a huge amount of attention, praise and love that most people can‚Äôt give me, and when they can‚Äôt give me it hurts like ||hell||.
[2021-04-19 21:10:20] (707013290928111718) Gobernador toot#4742: one time i ||died||
[2021-04-20 16:43:51] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I‚Äôm pretty mad at my psychiatrist (I just had my appointment)
She didn‚Äôt really let me talk about the ||mood swings|| or whatever they are I didn‚Äôt even get a chance to tell her exactly how ||depressed|| I have been the past few days. She said it was good that I‚Äôve been super happy for those three weeks and said that the drop in my mood probably ‚Äúseems bigger than it is‚Äù and I disagree with her because ||I‚Äôm literally wanting to kill myself|| ugh why can‚Äôt I just stay happy when I‚Äôm happy??? I know people like me better when I‚Äôm happy but ||I still deserve to die|| 
Sorry this turned from a mental illness discussion into a full blown rant. I‚Äôm sorry. The psychiatrist also said a lot of my issues were ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and talked about ||church related stuff such as the ‚Äúhand of God bringing her back to church‚Äù and implied that the same will happen to me (I used to be religious so I get where she‚Äôs coming from, but now I‚Äôm just scared)|| 
I feel terrible üòû
[2021-04-20 16:45:17] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: hey weehehe. i‚Äôm so sorry your psychiatrist didn‚Äôt properly listen to you about your mental health. i had the same issue with mine. so you‚Äôre not alone. <:zzAsterHeartHug:816901221653807146> please stay safe and we all love you

[2021-04-21 22:33:56] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Writing it makes a ton of sense. Sometimes a visual can be really helpful.
