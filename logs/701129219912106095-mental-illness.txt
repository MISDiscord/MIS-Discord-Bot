[2021-04-11 17:11:56] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Is it just me or does anybody feel like their mental illness affects thinking outside of the realms of their illness? Or is that just me?
I feel as if I have moments that make me seem "visibly mentally ill", but for the most part, generalized anxiety disorder has a reputation of being very hidden.

Idk maybe this is a ramble at this point ^^;
[2021-04-11 17:12:44] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: And I only mention GAD because I feel as if that is the disorder that affects how I interact with the world for the most part
[2021-04-11 17:18:24] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: honestly my biggest issue is that i constantly forget that mental illnesses are disorders so i always get mad at myself when i feel like i'm not functioning "normally"
[2021-04-11 17:19:13] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: but yeah definitely feel like it affects all aspects of my lif
[2021-04-11 17:19:55] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I can 100% understand that ^^; and I'm glad I'm not the only one
[2021-04-11 17:20:43] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I get angry at myself at times because of this misconception that I can control it/I caused it or something, haha. But I can totally relate
[2021-04-11 17:22:48] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Of course trauma affects all aspects of functioning but I do believe my GAD/mental disorders is much more of a game player in interactions than some mental health professionals think, but there's still so much research to be done, so🤷
[2021-04-11 17:23:52] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i mean they are disorders because they affect your normal daily ability to function
[2021-04-11 17:24:43] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: oh yeah of course! But in my mind I could have "prevented" it or something lol. My logic 😐
[2021-04-11 17:24:56] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: no worries though I know this isn't true
[2021-04-11 17:26:08] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: Just giving my experience here: my mental illness affects every area of my life sadly and if I’m in a bad day can really paralyze me. <:Thinking:820239274670424104>
[2021-04-11 17:27:27] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Right???? I'm glad I'm not alone in feeling this way, it can really be a massive influence
[2021-04-11 17:27:53] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Also, sending hearts for those times <:HeartGivingPengu:798783648086229022>
[2021-04-11 17:28:13] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: it can sadly.
[2021-04-11 17:29:17] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Exactly, exactly.
[2021-04-11 17:30:15] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: And then in my case specifically, I feel as if people aren't exactly caring for those visibly ill with a sickness they can't see, so it's like you've gotta hide yourself all day just to keep composed
[2021-04-11 17:31:00] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: I always pretend I’m all fine when I’m going insane inside
[2021-04-11 17:31:02] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: can you censor the part regarding ||eating||
[2021-04-11 17:31:08] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: yeah sure
[2021-04-11 17:31:10] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: sorry
[2021-04-11 17:32:45] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: But yeah it's intense XD glad I know now that I'm not alone in that. :>
[2021-04-11 17:32:48] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: sometimes i honestly just wish that someone would just sit with me and tell me everything is gonna be ok but idk if that's just a result of trauma
[2021-04-11 17:32:59] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: oh I totally understand that
[2021-04-11 17:34:11] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: same, I just want someone to hold me and tell me they are gonna always be here for me and that they love me no matter what.
[2021-04-11 17:34:22] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Personally I wish people would be a bit more compassionate with people with poor or different mental health than them
[2021-04-11 17:35:32] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah agreed. i've had some bad experiences with people rude regarding mental health.
[2021-04-11 17:36:09] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: absolutely
[2021-04-11 17:38:38] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I have had to totally disregard my own mental health at the cost of seeming 100% "sane" to others, and I will admit that that has totally blown up in my face ^^;
[2021-04-11 17:39:28] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Because now I can't pretend that there's nothing going on, even though I've had full-on ||breakdowns|| in front of people before, and I just ||get yelled at about it||
[2021-04-11 17:41:11] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: my ex friends got mad at me that my ||depressive episode|| was going on so long and so they started calling me ||manipulative and a psycho|| behind my back. the ||psycho|| part was referring to the fact that i needed to take ||medications for my disorders||
[2021-04-11 17:42:02] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: See, that's so disrespectful. I'm glad that they're ex-friends now, but you shouldn't have had to go through that in the first place
[2021-04-11 17:42:07] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: super ignorant
[2021-04-11 17:43:29] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah it just reminded me how rude people are
[2021-04-11 17:43:35] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Definitely.
[2021-04-11 17:45:49] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: It's super sad, I think. But thankfully there are people who understand and stuff. Tbh the stigma is one of the biggest influences stopping me from taking care of myself
[2021-04-11 17:46:07] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I take care of myself of course, but could I do more? Definitely
[2021-04-11 17:47:19] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: when I’m having a ||depressive episode ||my mom calls me ||lazy|| and my dad says I’m being ||ridiculous|| when I ||cry||. *sighs* So much stigma.
[2021-04-11 17:47:38] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Yep yeeeeeeeeeeeeep I TOTALLY get what you mean

[2021-04-11 17:47:49] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: you're definitely not alone in that
[2021-04-11 17:48:16] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: My dad has told me that I do things slowly out of spite
[2021-04-11 17:48:49] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Like, where does this come from? Idk, they need something to explain it because they don't experience it, I guess.
[2021-04-11 17:51:45] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: But, I'm glad that we can kind of relate and be supportive of one another about this stuff.

[2021-04-17 19:43:31] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: LIKE a loud noise happened and now I'm just agitated
[2021-04-17 19:43:57] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Well, it hasn't messed up my entire day, I'm exaggerating. But it was still so annoying 😐
[2021-04-17 19:44:27] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: *sigh* It's so weird. ^^;
[2021-04-17 19:49:03] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: It’s not weird. Loud noises startle me too, specially noises like a train passing by and it makes me really stressed and agitated.
[2021-04-17 19:49:50] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Seriously?! I'm so glad I'm not the only one. It's like loud noises physically hurt even if they aren't loud enough to actually hurt your ears
[2021-04-17 19:50:22] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: A spray can fell over on the floor so it was much smaller but *still*

[2021-04-18 21:11:19] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: ~~I wanted to contribute but looking at this channel makes me think I write here too much lol~~^^;

Anyway, this is an open letter to both the supportive server and people who helped me get professional help. The other day when I was having a lot of symptoms and couldn't really differentiate myself from my illness, my friend basically was like, "you don't sound like yourself at all. Are you ||using drugs?||" and thinking about it now is *extremely* eye-opening. At the time I thought it was just silly, but thinking critically, that just goes to show you how this sickness *is sickness* even if I have trouble validating and taking care of myself sometimes. This was a little rambley but thought I should say something interesting!
[2021-04-19 19:18:46] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: it’s really cute how i can completely break down and be dancing to a random ed sheeran song 10 minutes later
[2021-04-19 19:19:36] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: and before i get judged for the ed sheeran, my spotify is on shuffle
[2021-04-19 19:24:14] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Hey not all Ed Sheeran is cringe
[2021-04-19 19:24:36] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: But also thats very relatable
[2021-04-19 19:31:20] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I was going to actually ask here about something sort of similar. I don’t want to diagnose myself for obvious reasons, and I’m not looking for a diagnosis, but I wanted to ask about ||mood swings||, if that’s the right term. 

I don’t know much about them, but sometimes I’ll be really *really* depressed and then I’ll think something or I’ll wake up the next morning and then be super happy for a while until I’m back to depressed. I don’t know if that’s even what ||mood swings|| are, I just know with me sometimes it’s caused by something happening and sometimes it’s caused by random thoughts and sometimes it’s caused by seemingly nothing at all.  I think this started about 6 years ago, but at the time I ||wasn’t eating||, so I thought that was a temporary thing. 

Again, I’m not looking for a diagnosis, but I do want to know if I should talk to my psychiatrist about this tomorrow because I am diagnosed with depression but I do have happy amounts of time. Like how I was a happy for 3 weeks before that ended on Saturday. I don’t know how to explain.
[2021-04-19 19:39:35] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: I definitely think you should. I didn’t tell my psychiatrist about it until recently and i had to switch meds cause of it.
[2021-04-19 19:41:22] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Ok. I will. I’m just nervous because when I told the psychiatrist about how I got happier she probably thinks the meds are working  idk it’s hard oof
[2021-04-19 19:45:24] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: but it's being super happy
[2021-04-19 19:45:43] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: you should emphasize that it changes frequently
[2021-04-19 19:46:56] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I should keel better track of it, sometimes it changes throughout the day (a few hours maybe) and I don’t know what’s normal
[2021-04-19 19:47:04] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: It just depends
[2021-04-19 19:49:05] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i have the same thing so you're not alone
[2021-04-19 19:49:54] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Thanks. I know being happy all the time is unrealistic but I had it for 3 weeks and now I really really miss it
[2021-04-19 19:55:15] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: Don’t mean to intrude but I can deff relate. I can be super happy for a few hours and then I end up very depressed out of the blue or sometimes caused by small comments others make or if a bad event happens. Sometimes it’s minutes, like happy-sad-happy-sad at all once.
[2021-04-19 19:55:52] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Yeah...emotions are difficult 
And you’re not intruding at all
[2021-04-19 19:57:09] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: I’m glad.
[2021-04-19 20:00:08] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: I get really intense ||mood swings || if I feel like that certain person doesn’t like me anymore or hates me, usually small comments like “I’m busy” or “I don’t want to talk right now” and I end up crying for days. After the ||depression||, I get furious at that person and I want to ditch them but then they talk again to me so I go to being happy again. Even pictures of being with friends is enough to make me feel like I’m not being appreciated and that that person doesn’t really care about me.
[2021-04-19 20:00:51] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Oh the “I don’t wanna talk right now” one makes me really upset too
[2021-04-19 20:04:00] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: Yeah, deff. I always wondered if this is how a “normal” person would react to such things or if I’m just too sensitive. I also tend to have ||codependent|| tendencies.
[2021-04-19 20:04:38] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah i have a really bad fear of abandonment so the slightest change in tone causes me to spiral
[2021-04-19 20:07:01] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: And when they don’t reply to you after a few hours and you are like “Why aren’t they replying to me, do they hate me” and then I go like to “they suck anyway, they were super toxic and mean so might as well ditch them since they prefer to be with other people” and then they reply and they just went to go somewhere and I don’t know what to do anymore smh.
[2021-04-19 20:07:02] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I used to have bad abandonment fears because of certain things with certain people, now I just think about irl people too much
[2021-04-19 20:08:27] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah it sucks
[2021-04-19 20:09:46] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I wish I could be emotionally independent I guess. Sometimes (when I’m super happy) I am but I’m still thinking about certain people then other times when I’m sad it’s awful being alone ?? Idk
[2021-04-19 20:10:30] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah i'm very emotionally dependent on people
[2021-04-19 20:11:38] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: My self worth is dependent on what others think of me, specially some very close people, so any good opinion they have gives me extreme happiness and any criticism makes me feel like a ||worthless || waste of space and that I’m a horrible and evil person.
[2021-04-19 20:12:36] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Why’s this me tho (sorry I’m not trying to be funny I’m just relating to it too much)
[2021-04-19 20:13:13] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: No worries. It’s all good.
[2021-04-19 20:13:47] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: same
[2021-04-19 20:17:45] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: I guess all I really want is someone to tell me that they see me and love me and that they are gonna always be there for me and prioritize me over everything else. I want to feel like I’m someone’s top priority for once. Ik it’s unhealthy but I crave for a huge amount of attention, praise and love that most people can’t give me, and when they can’t give me it hurts like ||hell||.
[2021-04-19 21:10:20] (707013290928111718) Gobernador toot#4742: one time i ||died||
[2021-04-20 16:43:51] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I’m pretty mad at my psychiatrist (I just had my appointment)
She didn’t really let me talk about the ||mood swings|| or whatever they are I didn’t even get a chance to tell her exactly how ||depressed|| I have been the past few days. She said it was good that I’ve been super happy for those three weeks and said that the drop in my mood probably “seems bigger than it is” and I disagree with her because ||I’m literally wanting to kill myself|| ugh why can’t I just stay happy when I’m happy??? I know people like me better when I’m happy but ||I still deserve to die|| 
Sorry this turned from a mental illness discussion into a full blown rant. I’m sorry. The psychiatrist also said a lot of my issues were “normal” and talked about ||church related stuff such as the “hand of God bringing her back to church” and implied that the same will happen to me (I used to be religious so I get where she’s coming from, but now I’m just scared)|| 
I feel terrible 😞
[2021-04-20 16:45:17] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: hey weehehe. i’m so sorry your psychiatrist didn’t properly listen to you about your mental health. i had the same issue with mine. so you’re not alone. <:zzAsterHeartHug:816901221653807146> please stay safe and we all love you

[2021-04-20 18:07:49] (130075894931914752) kristianuɐıʇsıɹʞ#0707: I  used to see shadows. one time when i was trying to sleep i saw someone standing next to my bed

[2021-04-20 18:12:38] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We have audio hallucinations from time to time. Usually sounds like someone yelling at us, or sometimes we hear our name or footsteps.
[2021-04-20 18:13:23] (130075894931914752) kristianuɐıʇsıɹʞ#0707: It was kinda like two voices that blurred out my inner voice

[2021-04-20 18:18:06] (130075894931914752) kristianuɐıʇsıɹʞ#0707: Yeah that is an visual hallucination. everyone can get hallucinations without it being schizophrenia
[2021-04-20 18:18:38] (130075894931914752) kristianuɐıʇsıɹʞ#0707: Voices are also normal for people without schizophrenia
[2021-04-20 18:19:48] (130075894931914752) kristianuɐıʇsıɹʞ#0707: Those things are called positive symptoms. but what makes a psychologist think you are schizophrenic is if you have negative symptoms
[2021-04-20 18:19:59] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: I did for a few months (a few years ago) have a voice in my head that constantly talked to me. Never rly understood what that was about.

[2021-04-20 18:31:51] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: About the whole negative symptom thing.

Because, my first question would be: Is this <#701129219912106095> room meant to "just" talk about all of our mental illnesses? 😛
I know that there are general severs, but this chat seems like being made to describe each mental illnesses of us.

[2021-04-25 19:06:23] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: I'm not diagnosed of any personality disorder yet because he doesn't allow me to.

[2021-04-25 19:11:19] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: I was about to say:
[2021-04-25 19:11:20] (467747778622259221) greywolfember#0072: oh wait I think I might have misunderstood, or maybe I didn't communicate my tone right? I didn't mean that as a 'you didn't do that and I'm asking to you', I meant that as a 'yeah I completely understand, no pressure at all from any of us to share anything you don't want to or can't share'
[2021-04-25 19:11:43] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: I didn't mean that but nvm
[2021-04-25 19:11:44] (467747778622259221) greywolfember#0072: I don't think he was calling jupiter a sheep, though I'm not completely sure what vlok was saying heh
[2021-04-25 19:12:14] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: I hate swearing even though it's somewhat allowed when censored, so I use nice words.

[2021-04-25 19:14:00] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: Now to get back to the thing, "He" is him. Simplified, I appear to have a second me, but not me - me, but ... not me - kind of me.
[2021-04-25 19:14:13] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: Aye, I'm such a champ at talkin'.

[2021-04-25 19:14:53] (467747778622259221) greywolfember#0072: you mean it's a little like there's another person in your head who's you, but not you, but sort of you (and so on)?
[2021-04-25 19:15:02] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah they don't diagnose till adulthood due to the personality still developing through the teenage years
[2021-04-25 19:15:07] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: Well, yes.
[2021-04-25 19:15:29] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: Then I hope "he" dissappears 'till I'm 18.
[2021-04-25 19:17:29] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: "He" is like both an ally and enemy to me.
To be honest, I don't like him, neither does he like me.
Sorry, it's kinda complicated to explain it while sounding simple.
[2021-04-25 19:18:57] (467747778622259221) greywolfember#0072: that's okay, you can keep explaining if you want to get it better?
[2021-04-25 19:23:00] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: I could but I would need to censor many things eventully.

[2021-04-27 20:08:51] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: I'm not asking to be diagnosed I'm just asking for advice
[2021-04-27 20:09:44] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Like many of my partners and friends have said they think I have DID because I switch between mercury nash and baby and I act completely different when I'm them but I'm always fully aware?
[2021-04-27 20:09:50] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Is that something that's possible
[2021-04-27 20:11:00] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: (I do not have DID or OSDD) it's possible to be aware during switches as far as I know, but do you feel like yourself during the personality changes?
[2021-04-27 20:11:10] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: or, really, the perceived changes
[2021-04-27 20:11:19] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: idk if it's your personality or alters so I can't say

[2021-04-27 20:12:41] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Sometimes? Like it feels like a different part of me? And sometimes it's hard to go back to mercury when I'm being nash.
[2021-04-27 20:13:07] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Like one time my bf was asking to talk to mercury and I was trying to focus on coming back to myself but it was so difficult
[2021-04-27 20:13:40] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Ah, I can get what you mean
[2021-04-27 20:14:32] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Do you think you should discuss with your doctor?
[2021-04-27 20:14:48] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Do you think you should discuss with your doctor?
[2021-04-27 20:15:24] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Yea I'm definitely gonna go that
[2021-04-27 20:15:46] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Just have to find a day to do it since I just started my new job
[2021-04-27 20:16:04] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Yeah definitely understandable
[2021-04-27 20:16:53] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I hope it goes well! Some docs don't get it but I really hope yours does so you can start figuring it all out!
[2021-04-27 20:17:13] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Yea I really hope
[2021-04-27 20:17:35] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Meanwhile anyone that does have DID please feel free to reach out. I'd like to learn more about it
[2021-04-27 20:19:38] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: to me that sounds like some sort of osdd maybe, i would definitely recommend going to a professional and asking them about it! we're happy to answer any questions you might have if you want ^^
[2021-04-27 20:19:54] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Osdd?
[2021-04-27 20:20:10] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: So are you able to switch alters and always be aware of what's going on?
[2021-04-27 20:21:26] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: other specified dissociative disorder. there's different types of it, osdd 1a means you have amnesia but less distinct alters. osdd 1b is no switch amnesia (so what you might be describing there) but alters are distinct from each other, osdd 1 is no switch amnesia and less distinct alters
[2021-04-27 20:22:06] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: there's also something called "shell alters" that only exists in osdd 1b systems iirc, they're like alters who never/barely ever leave front
[2021-04-27 20:25:18] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: so they're influenced by whoever is in front with them
[2021-04-27 20:31:09] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Oh wow I didnt know any of that
[2021-04-27 20:31:59] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: This is certainly something to talk to a professional about. Dissociative disorders are very complex, and something like OSDD should not ever be diagnosed alone. There's a lot of good help available in the medical system. It can be scary to share with medical professionals, but they won't take away your freedom. They will just try to offer you options to figure out how to live with whatever problems you're experiencing.
[2021-04-27 20:33:02] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: definitely! it's good to share your experience and ask for advice etc, but in the end only your mental health professional can diagnose you
[2021-04-27 20:51:11] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Yes thank you guys!
[2021-04-27 20:51:14] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Was just trying to get some info and yall definitely helped!❤
[2021-04-27 20:51:30] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Will try to make an app soon to discuss this with my therapist

[2021-04-27 21:25:10] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: I experience a similar thing: I can experience switches (for a lack of a better word) and feel like a completely different person with major speech differences, addressing people on diff ways, and have different emotions, opinions and atitudes, sometimes it can also feel like my body isn’t my own, or this life isn’t my own, etc... There’s not a major identity change such as diff likes, hobbies but I deff feel like someone else.  There’s also a lack of amnesia, so I remember everything about that time but it feels hazy or like a dream, or like it belongs to someone else. Just sharing my experience. Btw, still need to check with a professional to get an official diagnosis.
[2021-04-27 21:27:22] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: I actually have to say that your description seems similar like my case, though I too need an official diagnosis which might take some years

[2021-04-27 21:31:50] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: I’ve also had a really weird experience that like only happened once so far, but it was probably the scariest experience of my life: I felt like emotions and thoughts separate from my own, loss of control over my own movements and particularly face, thoughts and emotions going back and fourth and after a while, just like in a snap all of went away and I felt like myself again. It was quite scary tbh and it took me one hour to return to normal. Still haven’t figured it out what actually happened tbh.
[2021-04-27 21:32:00] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: Have you experience¥ this?
[2021-04-28 01:02:49] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Time to play the game of "do work past midnight for a year and then ask why I'm extremely fatigued and unable to express or feel emotions properly today" <:BlobThinkingFast:798783709506568192> 
Anyway do you guys think that's my lack of sleep? Or something else? ~~Because it can't possibly be due to my mental illness~~
[2021-04-28 05:45:23] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: In a way, yes. It's quite scary that we experience similar things.
[2021-04-28 06:46:17] (394933466682228787) Kimigia#1061: got diagnosed with bipolar disorder. kinda scary, idk what to do now

[2021-04-28 06:52:08] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: The fact that you have it diagnosed, if true, can help you understanding it.
[2021-04-28 06:52:36] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: First of all, do you know what exactly your disorder is described as? I do, if you ask
[2021-04-28 06:54:55] (394933466682228787) Kimigia#1061: all i got told was bipolar disorder. the specific type (1 or 2) wasn't specified. i'm going back next week so i can find out the details
[2021-04-28 06:55:58] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: Good luck then, you will find it out then.
I know that saying things like "It's fine, just breathe" won't calm you down.
[2021-04-28 07:40:40] (394933466682228787) Kimigia#1061: yeah, thanks. just kinda nervous what to do with this information lol

[2021-04-28 11:59:38] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: do i get tested for depression
[2021-04-28 11:59:42] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: how does the test work
[2021-04-28 12:05:01] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Ah, you can go to a psychologist/psychiatrist/therapist and they'll probably give you a questionnaire to fill out.
[2021-04-28 12:05:46] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: do
[2021-04-28 12:05:54] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: you think i'll get a diagnosis that session
[2021-04-28 12:06:06] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: i'm in aus
[2021-04-28 12:08:21] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: You might if the questionnaire is conclusive, but sometimes they'll ask for more than one session to figure out specific symptoms because there are different types of depression and different kinds of treatment for them.
[2021-04-28 12:09:10] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: i have adhd inattentive and some autistic symptom they'll go over the results of my testing next session
[2021-04-28 12:09:34] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: i don't know if i have depression or not
[2021-04-28 12:10:13] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Yeah they might actually mention it in your test results, like, "has some depressive symptoms" or something like that if they feel like it
[2021-04-28 12:10:45] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I know in the US they have a tendency to mark up possible symptoms that could accompany the diagnosis
[2021-04-28 12:13:43] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Oh my bad idk if you saw my response so I'll give ya a ping <@!329158285846642690>

[2021-04-28 12:15:28] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: do i have it
[2021-04-28 12:16:09] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Yeah you could still have depression even if you don't show visible symptoms, but with a therapist or another professional you'd be able to tell with the questionnaire...usually
[2021-04-28 12:17:59] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: For me personally no one irl can really tell that I have mental illnesses unless something triggers me, and even then a lot of my symptoms are internal. Only one therapist has been able to see that I've had dysthymia/depression symptoms, so it depends on the person and how honest you're willing/able to be abt it
[2021-04-28 12:19:29] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: what's dysthymia again?
[2021-04-28 12:19:35] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I mean, I live with my family and they reject that I have any mental illness symptoms all the time even though I'm the most mentally ill when I'm in my house <:mood:703721909321203773>
[2021-04-28 12:19:38] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: i mean if no one notices anything
[2021-04-28 12:19:42] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: does it really exist
[2021-04-28 12:19:45] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Low-grade persistent depression
[2021-04-28 12:19:53] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: oh yeah
[2021-04-28 12:19:57] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: over several years
[2021-04-28 12:20:01] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: sorry to hear that
[2021-04-28 12:20:30] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Yeah, I mean, people don't see that I have type 1 diabetes unless I show them my ||insulin|| pump so things can exist even if they aren't visible
[2021-04-28 12:21:17] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: And no worries! I'm used to it but I do break out of it every now and again.
[2021-04-28 12:21:30] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: that's pretty good
[2021-04-28 12:21:38] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: ok so next appointment is in like 2 weeks
[2021-04-28 12:21:49] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: i don't really know if i do have it
[2021-04-28 12:21:51] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: like
[2021-04-28 12:22:03] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: idk
[2021-04-28 12:22:52] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: right now i feel fine
[2021-04-28 12:23:14] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Well, you can always talk to your mental health professional about it! It's never harmful to ask about the symptoms you have
[2021-04-28 12:23:45] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: And there are always moments where you can feel fine and then have a return of symptoms, or have temporary symptoms but have them go away, etc.
[2021-04-28 12:23:59] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: So it definitely wouldn't hurt to try
[2021-04-28 12:25:05] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: i don't want to find out because my dad is busy enough already
[2021-04-28 12:25:40] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: What do you think would change if you had a name for your symptoms? /gen
[2021-04-28 12:25:53] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: people would treat me differently
[2021-04-28 12:26:10] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: which is probably unavoidable
[2021-04-28 12:26:18] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: but it would mean i can get treatment
[2021-04-28 12:26:42] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: i don't know if talking helps me
[2021-04-28 12:26:51] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: because i *really* suck at expression
[2021-04-28 12:27:45] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Hey, I mean, treatment is a *really* big plus to figuring out if you have depression, and people won't necessarily treat you different, and you get to decide who you tell.
[2021-04-28 12:28:00] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: And same, I'm telling ya <:mood:703721909321203773>
[2021-04-28 12:28:14] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: people as in my family
[2021-04-28 12:28:19] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: and what if it isn't depression
[2021-04-28 12:28:24] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: am i just a lazy person
[2021-04-28 12:30:37] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Hey, I don't think you're lazy. Lazy people don't *care* about things, but you seem to. And besides, people don't choose to have no energy. It can feel like you should just try harder sometimes, but if you had it your way, would you be struggling right now?
[2021-04-28 12:31:03] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: maybe
[2021-04-28 12:35:24] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I think so. I guess I can give an example. I love so many things, and I have a lot of hobbies. But recently I haven't been able to sleep well at all. I'm extremely fatigued, and because of my anxiety, I'm scared to go to sleep at night, even when I've worked extremely hard during the day. So... I haven't been able to do any of my hobbies. That makes me *unimaginably* upset, so I don't think it's my fault that I can't seem to do them
[2021-04-28 12:36:40] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: And also, your family shouldn't treat you differently for your diagnosis, but if they do, I think that's more ignorance on their part
[2021-04-28 12:37:05] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: no they'll be more caring or whatever
[2021-04-28 12:37:08] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: get me outside more
[2021-04-28 12:37:46] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: That's great! I'm glad you have a supportive family! I think if they did that it would actually help you.
[2021-04-28 12:38:49] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: And I think it's fantastic that they would help you, because that's what family is for :>
[2021-04-28 12:40:06] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: idk if it's real
[2021-04-28 12:40:10] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: i don't have any real reasons
[2021-04-28 12:40:25] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: i don't know if it will be worth it
[2021-04-28 12:40:57] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I mean, people can be depressed without any reason to be. The brain decides what you feel at the end of the day
[2021-04-28 12:41:23] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: And it won't take long anyway, it's a quick session. You might be able to just talk about it with your therapist
[2021-04-28 12:41:41] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: ig i'll do it
[2021-04-28 12:41:50] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: thanks
[2021-04-28 12:42:10] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Np! Good luck, I'm rooting for ya! I'm sure it will go just fine :>
[2021-04-28 12:42:50] (329158285846642690) RubberDuck#4264: 9 days until
[2021-04-28 12:43:25] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: You can do it~
[2021-04-28 14:24:04] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Ok so...
Because I have no professional guidance, what do you do when you feel like you're gonna pop from pent up emotions? (But I also kind of have inappropriate affect? Idk I'm not really expressing my emotions outwardly, I just look tired so no blowing up, no worries)

Do you ground? Self-soothe?
[2021-04-28 14:52:09] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: WOAH okay I didn't ||feel real|| when I woke up from a quick nap I just took should I be concerned
[2021-04-28 14:53:17] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Maybe it was sleepiness nvm I think I just over exaggerated. Anyway if anybody has tips for those pent up emotions ping me, I'm going on do not disturb mode hehe
[2021-04-28 17:55:45] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: Hello
[2021-04-28 17:56:13] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: Is this the right channel?
[2021-04-28 17:56:34] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: for what specifically?
[2021-04-28 17:57:09] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: I need advice? I guess.
[2021-04-28 17:57:18] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: About DID and stuff
[2021-04-28 17:57:31] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: you could ask it in <#702178014192074775>
[2021-04-28 17:58:25] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: Idk. My friend told me to come here because he couldn’t help me solve my problem, I guess
[2021-04-28 17:59:55] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: Good luck finding a solution but keep in mind that we're no one to judge what you have, we're only people who either know a bit of your illnesses, or share them. A therapist might be more helpful than us, when it's about diagnosing and co.
[2021-04-28 18:01:23] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: I don’t need help with diagnosing. My problem is that I’m going through an identity crisis after my system decided to reset itself. What channel should I go for to find help with that..?
[2021-04-28 18:02:02] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I don't think this is a bad channel to ask. Or in advice as <@!772525174791733258> said. There are some systems here that might be able to help!
[2021-04-28 18:02:02] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: Probably the advice one for advice, but what you say seem not too far fetched to be uncommon.
[2021-04-28 18:02:35] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: No matter where, describing your problem fully might help finding a solution.
[2021-04-28 18:03:32] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: Should I go on?
[2021-04-28 18:03:55] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Go for it, <@!662800329150169121> ! :>
[2021-04-28 18:03:58] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: It is okay to talk about mental illnesses in a mental illness room. Of course
[2021-04-28 18:04:56] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -You have our Attention, fellow individual of an illness.-
[2021-04-28 18:05:42] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: Tw: Idk. Just tw-ing it because I don’t want to trigger anyone||So about a month ago I learned I had alters. Today, I had a massive episode and my system....reset? I feel like I’ve lost my personality and I don’t honestly know what to do.||
[2021-04-28 18:06:56] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -A system is something very complex. How do you feel? Numb?-
[2021-04-28 18:07:04] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: Yeah. Completely
[2021-04-28 18:07:34] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: I’ve been having troubles for a while, namely with imposter syndrome and not being able to give my alters control
[2021-04-28 18:08:17] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -I, too, happen to often feel that way, but what exactly I am remains unknown.
So, you know you have the impostor syndrome, or got diagnosed with it?
[2021-04-28 18:08:59] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: I know I have imposter syndrome. It’s part of my ||trauma||
[2021-04-28 18:09:54] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -Do you want to tell us of your traumatic history?
Okay then, so. How many alters do you have? Did you had? What do you think "feels" different?
[2021-04-28 18:10:09] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -Do you want to tell us of your traumatic history?
Okay then, so. How many alters do you have? Did you had? What do you think "feels" different?-
[2021-04-28 18:12:17] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: For the first part, it’s ||emotionally abusive dad. I still live with him and he constantly gaslights me and ignores my pain and plight. He yelled at me so much that I had to split my emotions into different personalities||
[2021-04-28 18:12:33] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: And the second part? I had like 25 before the reset
[2021-04-28 18:12:57] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: The only thing that feels different is now my brain feels super tangled
[2021-04-28 18:13:02] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: Though it usually does
[2021-04-28 18:13:38] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -Not just a few, but nothing too uncommon.
You trauma is, of course, an unfortunate experience. Hopefully you get into a better situation soon enough-.
[2021-04-28 18:13:51] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -Not just a few, but nothing too uncommon.

[2021-04-28 18:14:32] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: So, your mind appears to be not just numb but irriated, confused of who is the real "you", and who is the main one?
[2021-04-28 18:14:42] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -Vlok Fox — heute um 20:14 Uhr
So, your mind appears to be not just numb but irriated, confused of who is the real "you", and who is the main one?-
[2021-04-28 18:15:13] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: Yeah
[2021-04-28 18:15:25] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: I feel tangled
[2021-04-28 18:15:48] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: Like all my personalities are wired together in an unfortunate fashion
[2021-04-28 18:16:34] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -Do you want to "split" them again or what is your plan?-
[2021-04-28 18:17:33] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: Split them again
[2021-04-28 18:17:39] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: I can’t function with them tangeled
[2021-04-28 18:18:39] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: I think I overloaded my system and it caused it to start mixing personalities
[2021-04-28 18:19:28] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -Are you thinkin' to be seperated of this mix, or do you think to be "not the true you"?-
[2021-04-28 18:19:48] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: I can’t parse that. What do you mean?
[2021-04-28 18:20:31] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -You describe your personalities to be fuzed together, but wrongfully. This should mean you wouldn't be aware of who is who.-
[2021-04-28 18:20:54] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: Yes.
[2021-04-28 18:22:00] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -So we know your problem now. How come you appear to instinctively think to be the "real you" and why are you the only one able to interact?
[2021-04-28 18:22:32] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -So we know your problem now. How come you appear to instinctively think to be the "real you" and why are you the only one able to interact?-
[2021-04-28 18:24:53] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: Oh I’m not the real me. I don’t know what I am. I’m just a bunch of tangled wires
[2021-04-28 18:26:06] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -Understandable.-
[2021-04-28 18:26:45] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -If there is a true real you, you don't know who it is, but someone in this tangled mess is supposed to be it, you think.-
[2021-04-28 18:26:53] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: t yeah
[2021-04-28 18:27:35] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -But you share the same trauma & memories the one who you think of being the real you had / has?-
[2021-04-28 18:27:56] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: Yeah, in a sense
[2021-04-28 18:28:17] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -May I know what you mean with that?-
[2021-04-28 18:28:28] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: our wires are crossed. We share some memories. We don’t others
[2021-04-28 18:28:51] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: We can’t front because of it
[2021-04-28 18:29:21] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -That helps understanding your situation more.-
[2021-04-28 18:30:18] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -So, you don't think to have all of the main memories, but either different or quite other versions, if not just a broken mess of pieces of memories of the past.-
[2021-04-28 18:31:21] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: Yes. We’ve been tangled and broken, so we can’t quite tell who did what or when. Or who’s talking when.
[2021-04-28 18:32:18] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -Ah, I get that. Hmmm-
[2021-04-28 18:32:57] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -I don't fully know how to "cure" you of your tangled mess by now, but I will think about a solution.-
[2021-04-28 18:33:15] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: We just need to untangle it
[2021-04-28 18:33:18] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -A true therapist would do better than me though.-
[2021-04-28 18:33:41] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: Yes, but considering I still live with my parents, telling a therapist I have DID would probably not end well for me
[2021-04-28 18:34:30] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: It depends on your parents.
Having did is nothing bad, or evil.
[2021-04-28 18:34:55] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -Indeed, but your parents appear to be abusive to you.-
[2021-04-28 18:36:57] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Don't tell your therapist you have DID then? Self-diagnosis is a trap. The most fundamental thing about mental illnesses is that they prevent a person from drawing logical/correct conclusions about the world.
[2021-04-28 18:37:12] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Tell your therapist what you're struggling with.
[2021-04-28 18:37:33] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -As much as I would like to find a better solution, Alora is right.-
[2021-04-28 18:45:04] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: What do you mean
[2021-04-28 18:59:16] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: well <@!662800329150169121> , I think they just mean that it might be best to talk about it with a professional because it is a very confusing and hard thing to handle on your own, no matter the diagnosis. I remember before I was diagnosed with my anxiety disorders, I just felt hopeless and confused when I experienced strange symptoms. But because I had a mental health professional, it really helped me understand how to take care of myself :>

...however, I do understand why you wouldn't want to talk about it with your therapist. Maybe you can compromise and only talk about specific parts of your trauma, and focus more on present issues? Specifically discuss "motivational interviewing", which focuses on present-day problems and how to handle them.
[2021-04-28 19:02:18] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I hope that could help, and that it wasn't too much ><
[2021-04-28 19:26:24] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Hey <@!662800329150169121> are you alright?
[2021-04-28 19:50:24] (662800329150169121) heywhatthefuck#0004: Yes
[2021-04-28 19:59:50] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: That's good then
[2021-04-28 20:00:08] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Just making sure, <@!662800329150169121> because you hadn't responded in a bit!
[2021-04-28 20:22:30] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: is laughing alone for like few minutes bad?
[2021-04-28 20:22:50] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: like nothing makes me laugh it just comes from nowhere
[2021-04-28 20:26:01] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I don't think so, but if you are worried about it you can talk to a mental health professional
[2021-04-28 20:26:33] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Does it happen often?
[2021-04-28 20:27:45] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: like 2 times a week or 4 a month
[2021-04-28 20:28:08] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: it not does not reapeat sometimes
[2021-04-28 20:28:16] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: or just can't stop it
[2021-04-28 20:28:51] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: when i'm alone i'm somewhere areound emotion less
[2021-04-28 20:29:01] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: so i got ni idea
[2021-04-28 20:29:24] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Hm, if it's really concerning to you, definitely talk to a professional. It is possible that it could be a symptom of a problem, or could be standalone
[2021-04-28 20:29:38] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: but it only happends when i'm alone
[2021-04-28 20:29:56] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Do you think it could be a nervous tic?
[2021-04-28 20:30:07] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: no
[2021-04-28 20:30:13] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: idea
[2021-04-28 20:30:43] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: but i tend to talk to myself becuse it feels like i talk to someone
[2021-04-28 20:31:01] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: but at the same time i only answer myself
[2021-04-28 20:32:39] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Well you know, it could be a habit or something bigger, just as all things. Definitely talk to a professional if it's really worrying or troublesome to you! Even if it isn't a disorder, if you'd like to change it then a therapist could definitely help.
[2021-04-28 20:33:42] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: oh
[2021-04-28 20:34:33] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: ?
[2021-04-28 20:35:08] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: oof
[2021-04-28 20:35:28] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: idk my hand started to choke me  but that normal
[2021-04-28 20:35:48] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: nothing now
[2021-04-28 20:36:30] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Well alright then. Do you have a professional you could talk to about the things that are bothering you?
[2021-04-28 20:38:36] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: <@!746038046310531084> ?
[2021-04-28 20:38:39] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: yes?
[2021-04-28 20:38:48] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Oh, the question I asked above
[2021-04-28 20:38:58] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: oh
[2021-04-28 20:39:10] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: i don't
[2021-04-28 20:39:48] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: last time i asked for help it went horribly
[2021-04-28 20:40:46] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I can understand. I've had a lot of bad experiences with mental health professionals. But not each one is bad, so maybe you could write down the questions you had here and bring them to a doctor?
[2021-04-28 20:43:38] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: || last time i went to a psychiatrist was when i was 7 after a failed suicide attempt it just went down hill from there||
[2021-04-28 20:44:23] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Well, that was during a crisis situation so maybe it won't be as bad? But also I can understand why that was off-putting. Sorry that you had that experience.
[2021-04-28 20:44:48] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: i had 2 year of therapy
[2021-04-28 20:44:59] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: idk why but didn't help
[2021-04-28 20:45:34] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: and i was tried of it so i faked i was fine for 3 months so they let me go
[2021-04-28 20:45:59] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I understand, I did the same thing with my last therapist.
[2021-04-28 20:46:18] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: And it could have been the therapist or type of therapy
[2021-04-28 20:46:34] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: maybe
[2021-04-28 20:46:49] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: i got no idea
[2021-04-28 20:47:08] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: ooh i had it again
[2021-04-28 20:47:13] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Well, wouldn't hurt to try again I suppose! If it sucks after the first few appointments then you can drop it hehe
[2021-04-28 20:47:18] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Are you alright?
[2021-04-28 20:47:19] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: 5 seconds o laugh
[2021-04-28 20:47:25] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: XD oh
[2021-04-28 20:47:27] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: idk why
[2021-04-28 20:47:51] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: No clue! Maybe asking someone who's trained in it will help?
[2021-04-28 20:47:59] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: maybe
[2021-04-28 20:49:43] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: sorry had a little black screen
[2021-04-28 20:49:56] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: It's okay, but wdym?
[2021-04-28 20:50:17] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: And no worries, you can always take your time. But of course it's all trial and error.
[2021-04-28 20:50:37] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: ah i mean like it went black before my eyes i could not see a thing and i stoped feeling every part of my body for 5 seconds
[2021-04-28 20:51:14] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: but i'm sure it should be my health not mental but idk i'm not a pro
[2021-04-28 20:51:35] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: You should probably get that checked out as well, could be iron deficiency.
[2021-04-28 20:51:47] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: well idk about that
[2021-04-28 20:53:01] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: cuz i eat alot and still lose alot of weight idk why
[2021-04-28 20:53:49] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: like i eat pizzas alone they are like 30 cm or 12 inches
[2021-04-28 20:54:09] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: i do like running
[2021-04-28 20:54:12] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: so i do run alot
[2021-04-28 20:54:35] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: like i run 5 km today
[2021-04-28 20:54:44] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: and i do that nearly every day
[2021-04-28 20:55:03] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: but this is about mental problemo
[2021-04-28 20:55:14] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: so i will stop talkinga about that
[2021-04-28 20:55:23] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Haha, alrighty
[2021-04-28 20:58:26] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: But yeah <@!746038046310531084> , I do think that when you're comfortable (or even when you aren't comfortable), just jump at the opportunity to get a professional. I'm on a month waiting list to see a therapist because I'm kind of desperate so I can understand how annoying this whole process is, and I'm rooting for you!
[2021-04-28 21:00:29] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: i don't think my brain will allow me
[2021-04-28 21:00:48] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Oh yeah I felt that one lol
[2021-04-28 21:01:09] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: no like it will not allow me
[2021-04-28 21:01:13] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Perhaps you can ask your parents to make an appointment? Or go through your school counselor if you have one?
[2021-04-28 21:01:18] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: ?
[2021-04-28 21:01:32] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: cuz everything i say is monitered
[2021-04-28 21:01:51] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: some times i can't say a thing
[2021-04-28 21:01:58] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: becuse it does not allow me
[2021-04-28 21:02:31] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: i could be stoped mid sentece and not being allowed to talk anymore
[2021-04-28 21:02:54] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Hm, I understand. Maybe try writing it down and passing it to your parents when you feel safe?
[2021-04-28 21:03:10] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: i don't feel safe
[2021-04-28 21:03:13] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: at all
[2021-04-28 21:04:10] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Well, I mean, you feel safe enough to chat on Discord, right?
[2021-04-28 21:04:16] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: So maybe you could do the same
[2021-04-28 21:04:20] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Through a text or paper
[2021-04-28 21:04:40] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Or even tell your parents all of that
[2021-04-28 21:04:40] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: i could write it but i would not send it or give it
[2021-04-28 21:05:15] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Do you mind if we move to <#702982024914534511> ? I feel like the convo is getting long lol
[2021-04-28 21:05:21] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: ok

[2021-04-28 21:32:36] (662800329150169121) jackieeeeee#0096: I wish this nightmare was over
[2021-04-28 21:33:02] (662800329150169121) jackieeeeee#0096: I wish I didn’t have to worry about being plural
[2021-04-28 21:36:01] (793959398178684959) 7031#3532: nightmare called life or a literal nightmare
[2021-04-28 21:36:05] (793959398178684959) 7031#3532: or sleep paralysis
[2021-04-28 21:36:07] (793959398178684959) 7031#3532: ...
[2021-04-28 21:36:20] (793959398178684959) 7031#3532: damn I overthink
[2021-04-28 21:39:59] (793959398178684959) 7031#3532: so like I guess I'll just censor my entire thing
[2021-04-28 21:40:08] (793959398178684959) 7031#3532: much easier than censoring each word individually
[2021-04-28 21:41:24] (793959398178684959) 7031#3532: so like I'm a good student and shit, straight A student B), and I have loving parents and shit and they're well wealthy, not like mansion wealthy but they could afford me a 3D printer so not chum change
[2021-04-28 21:42:11] (793959398178684959) 7031#3532: well I guess it's natural that when I talk to one of my teachers about where I can get help they just brush me off and report me to the head teacher, nothing happened but I knew never to make that mistake again
[2021-04-28 21:42:17] (793959398178684959) 7031#3532: anyways that's when the fun part stops
[2021-04-28 21:44:28] (793959398178684959) 7031#3532: ||so like summer 2020 my mental health took a steep spiral downwards, I felt like I had a split personality. I had some relations with this girl and things were going well and shit cuz I'm a good guy to get along with you feel? but then I fucked it all up, yes I did and no I'm not taking the blame as pity or guilt it was literally my fault||
[2021-04-28 21:46:13] (793959398178684959) 7031#3532: ||so lets call this first girl Abbey cuz of A, Abbey was always fighting with Betsy right? so when she was doing her online tests she also fought. I tried to get inbetween and stop Abbey from going after her so she'd do better in her tests cuz, ngl, she was shit at school||
[2021-04-28 21:47:51] (793959398178684959) 7031#3532: ||then she told me to stop treating her like my child and shit and stuff and she forgot about that shortly after but I'm apparently not one to forget. Anyways a few days later I said out of frustration while playing a game "if you kill me one more time I swear I'll kill you" and apparently she was gon' attend a funeral that evening so u can imagine how that went, she just swore at me and ghosted me||
[2021-04-28 21:50:48] (793959398178684959) 7031#3532: ||now this ofc wasn't the first time she was rude to me like this but at the time I was obsessed with my project, robot build, and I realised how she's making me waste hella time on her antics so I called her a pisswanker out of sheer frustration. She got insulted straight after and I immediately apologised and I asked her to please stop being so rude but she fucking didn't, this bitch was determined to push me to my edge. So my usually kind self broke apart and I became an asshole too, and I said some things no one should ever say to others, completely out of character for me. By that I mean "I hope all those bitch friends of your's die" and "Who the fuck cares about you anyways"||
[2021-04-28 21:50:59] (793959398178684959) 7031#3532: I mean I usually wouldn't say that shit

[2021-04-28 21:51:40] (793959398178684959) 7031#3532: eventually I realised that my personality makes me completely unsuited for relationships of any kidn
[2021-04-28 21:52:29] (793959398178684959) 7031#3532: ||so I obv became really depressed, I mean obv I did||
[2021-04-28 21:53:05] (793959398178684959) 7031#3532: ||I started to cut myself, as you do, and I told my bestie about it. I also spoke to him regularly about my suicidal ideation||

[2021-04-29 12:17:44] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: But hey! Mental illness can be hard to notice in the throws of it.

[2021-04-29 12:18:40] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Just these past two months I was in an extremely strange headspace where I wasn't thinking logically or properly at all. But I didn't realize that I was thinking straight until I got out of it
[2021-04-29 12:19:04] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Which was honestly kind of dangerous because I had little regard to the self-destructive behaviors I had ^^;

[2021-04-29 12:31:07] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: XD  but in all seriousness mental illness can be very hard and then the stigma makes it harder
[2021-04-29 12:31:30] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: So I think the most important thing is self-compassion... but much easier said than done
[2021-04-29 12:33:38] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: people say mental illness is not as stigmatized but really all they did was romanticize anxiety disorders and depression and everything else didnt get any attention
[2021-04-29 12:33:51] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: people used to think "mentally ill" and think "||crazy person||"
[2021-04-29 12:34:00] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: now they think "very depressed person"
[2021-04-29 12:34:47] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Yeah it's definitely that one thing that someone on tiktok said
"Mental illness was commercialized not destigmatized"
[2021-04-29 12:35:29] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: like everyones like "uwu mental health" what they mean is "we will try and help sad people" while still being ableist and knowing jack shit about more serious or exotic condition
[2021-04-29 12:35:37] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: how many "mental health advocates" talk about schizophrenia
[2021-04-29 12:35:40] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: or bipolar disorder
[2021-04-29 12:35:42] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: or autism
[2021-04-29 12:36:23] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: or eating disorders
[2021-04-29 12:37:29] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Yep, you said it. And even when depression or anxiety is talked about, it's this sort of mild & acute version of the actual mental disorders
[2021-04-29 12:37:38] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: Yeah that too
[2021-04-29 12:38:00] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: people think depression is "oh no im sad" and not "well i literally cant hold a job because im too lethargic to think"
[2021-04-29 12:39:00] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Yeah exactly, and they definitely don't talk about the "ugly" parts of the conditions. It's infuriating because t's called an *illness* for a reason. It ISN'T pretty. But it still needs to be talked about
[2021-04-29 12:39:36] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: yeah the worst part of my condition is probably the delusions, but i cant talk about those with neurotypicals cause i know ill be looked at like i have 98 heads
[2021-04-29 12:39:59] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Yessssss exactly
[2021-04-29 12:40:11] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: And it's like that fear pervades other spaces too
[2021-04-29 12:40:29] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Even when you sit down to talk with a doctor you don't know how they're gonna respond
[2021-04-29 12:40:54] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Like my previous therapist kind of didn't believe me when I told her about my mental health history & symptoms
[2021-04-29 12:41:38] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: therapists can be part of stigma too
[2021-04-29 12:41:42] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: i have a friend with BPD
[2021-04-29 12:42:03] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: she says the diagnostic label is really bad because medical centers oftentimes purposefully try to avoid people with personality disorders
[2021-04-29 12:42:06] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: viewing them as "difficult"
[2021-04-29 12:42:45] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Yeah I've heard it's super bad for people with BPD. People have this huge opinion about it. It's like... you're a doctor. You should know what a condition is and not to fear it
[2021-04-29 12:42:55] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: cluster b in general might be one of the worst sets of disorders to get treatment for
[2021-04-29 12:43:07] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: because theyre heavily stigmatized and difficult to treat
[2021-04-29 12:43:20] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: That's like saying a dentist is afraid to work with people with cavities because there's a possibility that the patient will complain of pain 😐
[2021-04-29 12:43:29] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: (ironically, BPD actually has a better prognosis than depression and bipolar if properly treated)
[2021-04-29 12:43:35] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: (DBT does wonders)
[2021-04-29 12:43:47] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Wow I didn't know that, that's cool!
[2021-04-29 12:43:59] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: especially if its treated early
[2021-04-29 12:44:09] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: this is why BPD is the only personality disorder able to be diagnosed in childhood
[2021-04-29 12:44:13] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: the earlier therapy starts the better
[2021-04-29 12:44:54] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I've heard of people being diagnosed early with APD and SzPD too but that makes sense
[2021-04-29 12:44:57] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: you kid, but plenty of regular medical doctors pull this shit too

some doctors refuse to treat CFS patients cause they view them as "malingerers" or "fakers"
[2021-04-29 12:45:08] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Oh my gosh
[2021-04-29 12:45:11] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Ugh I hate that
[2021-04-29 12:45:17] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalitis
[2021-04-29 12:45:42] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Yeah I looked it up and knew immediately what you were talking about
[2021-04-29 12:45:46] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: It's so frustrating
[2021-04-29 12:46:25] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I mean I guess an example too would be when I was first diagnosed with diabetes. The first doctor I went to told my mother that I had A STOMACH VIRUS and that she was exaggerating (I was young)
[2021-04-29 12:46:51] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: i was taken to the ||hospital|| for a stomach virus and told it was a serious gastrointestinal condition until they did a basic test and i went home
[2021-04-29 12:47:19] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: to be fair they had a lot of reasons to believe i was in danger, since i have a medical history of being very sickly and vulnerable to serious disease
[2021-04-29 12:48:03] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Hey but I mean it's better to overexaggerate than underestimate and do no tests and see a patient ||die|| under a doctor's negligent care I think
[2021-04-29 12:48:12] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: suppose so
[2021-04-29 12:48:23] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: But it's like... why can't you do your job and stop giving an opinion?
[2021-04-29 12:49:51] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: But I digress...
About the whole stigma thing my therapist started to feed into my bad coping mechanisms when I was in therapy, because whenever I would talk about how I felt like people weren't recognizing how bad I was, she would tell me about how I wasn't doing as bad as I thought I was
[2021-04-29 12:50:56] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: But then expected me to stop neglecting my self-care (bc I told her that I was waiting until it was visible that I was sick to start taking care of myself)
[2021-04-29 12:51:13] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: my therapist always gets so concerned when i stop taking care of myself
[2021-04-29 12:51:38] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: i just got out of a ||depressive episode in which i barely ate or slept for 2 weeks, and lost 10 pounds||

[2021-04-29 12:52:27] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Hey, it's not your fault though. It takes time to adjust and learn coping skills, and sometimes your brain will seem to defy management in all honesty
[2021-04-29 12:56:29] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: its not my fault but i am still so tired

[2021-04-29 12:56:51] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: but its still so tiring

[2021-04-29 15:46:48] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: depressed inception
[2021-04-29 17:44:58] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I know that I get so anxious about anxiety that I try to deny it completely
[2021-04-29 23:09:28] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: normal for people with bipolar to spend majority of time depressed and not manic/hypomanic?
[2021-04-29 23:13:31] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: it depends on what type of bipolar you have
[2021-04-30 00:04:32] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I have bipolar 1 and I have a good amount of manic episodes with psychosis. My manic episodes can be days to weeks maybe even a month if It goes unnoticed. My depressive episodes are usually a few weeks to months. I am manic a decent bit when I’m off my meds. It’s normal for you to be more depressed than manic but if you are not manic at all you might want to ask to get assessed again as it could be a different mood disorder
[2021-04-30 01:33:42] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I'm getting so bad lately to where if one thing upsets me my entire plan of the day is ruined
[2021-04-30 02:07:48] (428653342999183370) keykey#0420: like 8 days ago i got diagnosed w sorta a mix between bipolar 1 and 2 (technically bipolar 2, but i have psychosis with my mania its just they havent seen enough manic states to qualify for type 1 bipolar) anddd then promptly got sent to ||a psych ward|| it actually ended ip being really good and im home now :)
[2021-04-30 02:12:47] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I’ve been to 2 psych wards and people say they are bad but they only problems I’ve had are when they don’t listen to my doctor’s about special food stuff other than that it’s good I like that the staff can monitor my mood and pick up on things I don’t see
[2021-04-30 02:22:48] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: idk. Is it a mood swing when you were feeling pretty good and then as soon as something makes you frustrated or stressed, or you disappoint yourself, your brain just goes down into the dirt
[2021-04-30 02:24:40] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Okay nvm I'm gonna go to bed I can feel the tears bubbling up. I feel bad now. Sorry for asking just to leave lol I didn't think I was gonna get this emotional. I'm sorry to anybody who read this <:feelingguilty:833549597439688725>
[2021-04-30 02:25:07] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: But if you have an answer you can answer. I'm not logged off yet, and I won't until maybe 10-20 min
[2021-04-30 02:25:39] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Okay tears are back in. I'm ready
[2021-04-30 02:30:13] (428653342999183370) keykey#0420: oh for sure, they were a bitch about my insulin when my pump broke and i had to do injections. some nurses were nice and let me do my own thing but a few were all like "bleh bleh its not doctors orders"
[2021-04-30 02:31:48] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: My mood swings with bipolar are usually caused by nothing , it’s just kinda everywhere
[2021-04-30 02:32:47] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Thank god they listened to you though. If u didn’t inject, something could have gone terribly wrong.
[2021-04-30 02:37:07] (673543138098413609) Something#4609: So turns out I have ||Health anxiety||

[2021-04-30 02:38:29] (673543138098413609) Something#4609: Hypochondria
[2021-04-30 02:38:29] (428653342999183370) keykey#0420: ugh fr they wanted me to correct after the meal instead of taking insulin before i eat 🙄
[2021-04-30 02:39:49] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Like obsessed with looking up symptoms and stuff
[2021-04-30 02:40:08] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: For trained nurses they really don’t know a lot

[2021-04-30 02:41:02] (673543138098413609) Something#4609: 
[2021-04-30 02:42:36] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Oh ok

[2021-04-30 02:43:06] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I struggled with it a lot in the past, but it is frustrating. I can relate
[2021-04-30 02:43:21] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Ask for anxiety meds for it, It should reduce the physical symptoms too
[2021-04-30 02:43:25] (428653342999183370) keykey#0420: right?? and its not like there werent other diabetics there... there was like, at least 3 other diabetics so like ???
[2021-04-30 02:43:33] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Also that makes sense. I feel better btw thank goodness. I played with my pet and it made me feel better
[2021-04-30 02:44:05] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: also that's so scary and #1 reason why I never wanna go to a psych ward bc I would definitely feel very scared abt my diabetes being neglected
[2021-04-30 02:44:58] (428653342999183370) keykey#0420: oof. i had to see the doctor there and explain to him and he gave me special orders so. was okay! and if youmre on a pump most of the time they are chill with u managing it urself
[2021-04-30 02:45:09] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I’ve never been to the over 18 wars but I’ve walked through and I can say that I will never been setting foot in there it’s scary. I wouldn’t recommend now that ur of age
[2021-04-30 02:45:30] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Oh that's pretty good then, I have a pump
[2021-04-30 02:45:43] (673543138098413609) Something#4609: Mine is Very bad and it’s starting to cause pain already just thinking about it
[2021-04-30 02:45:51] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I understand then. Okay I will be avoiding it then ;-;
[2021-04-30 02:46:25] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I mean. I'm pretty sure I can avoid it bc I'm "high-functioning" (I don't really like that concept tbh because I am struggling) but it still is a concern
[2021-04-30 02:47:12] (428653342999183370) keykey#0420: though they might have you on line of sight or 1on1 depending ur risk level because u ||can technically overdose on a pump pretty easily, so they might have a staff be in the same room or an arms reach away||
[2021-04-30 02:47:28] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: And perhaps you can start to learn some relazing techniques? I had a lot of psychosomatic symptoms too. Although I dealt with it as a very much younger person so I can't say 100% bc I never got psychological help as a kid
[2021-04-30 02:48:17] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Oh yikes. But I can understand that logically. Thankfully I will not do that bc I hate feeling low or high and bc of that I'm pretty well controlled. But I understand that there would be precautions I suppose
[2021-04-30 02:48:35] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Sorry to scare you but you are prob like 18,19 or 20 and there are like 40 and 50 year old creepy men. If you do HAVE to be put in one def research before you go and find one that separates the schizophrenics from the sucidal’ sad horrible as it sounds
[2021-04-30 02:48:41] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I feel like that would be good for me too bc of my separation anxiety lol

[2021-04-30 02:53:57] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: That isn't exactly true. The rules, especially in the US, vary greatly from state to state. There usually isn't mandatory reporting unless there is the possibility of immediate harm.

[2021-04-30 02:55:11] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Tennessee put me on handcuffs
[2021-04-30 02:55:13] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: In a cop car
[2021-04-30 02:55:23] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Your doctors will tell you what they have to report if you ask them.
[2021-04-30 02:55:29] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I was 14 and cooperative
[2021-04-30 02:56:07] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: My doctor didn’t tell me
[2021-04-30 02:56:38] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: But the hallucinations thing a therapist or doctor won’t call
[2021-04-30 02:56:44] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: The ER
[2021-04-30 02:56:57] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Yeah they had told me abt the ||suicidal|| and ||homicidal|| grounds for reporting, but I wasn't sure if anything else would be grounds for going in. Although I wish they had programs where you could get extensive help without it being so drastic
[2021-04-30 02:57:05] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: But if get brought in by a guardian to a psych ward and they evaluate you
[2021-04-30 02:57:12] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: And they find u are hallucinating
[2021-04-30 02:57:16] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: They will bring you in
[2021-04-30 02:57:33] (428653342999183370) keykey#0420: or are "gravely disabled" aka not able to take care of urself at all– one lady in my ward had such bad anxiety that she couldnt even leave the house without someone with her, panicked about being alone, etc.
[2021-04-30 02:57:43] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Yes, you will not be forced into anything unless there is immediate danger. The medical system understands that forcing people into situations they're not comfortable with will not lead to positive longterm outcomes.
[2021-04-30 02:57:55] (428653342999183370) keykey#0420: ^^
[2021-04-30 02:58:10] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Someone needs to tell Tennessee that
[2021-04-30 02:58:11] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: That definitely all makes sense, I can understand that
[2021-04-30 02:58:33] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Who the hell puts a 14 year old in the back of a cop car
[2021-04-30 02:58:37] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: With cuffs on
[2021-04-30 02:58:45] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Argh, that's sad. It's all very frustrating at the end of the day especially in the US
[2021-04-30 02:59:05] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Since we have to see or hear about it every other day
[2021-04-30 02:59:18] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Yes my other transportation was an ambulance when I was 15 tho and it was pleasant
[2021-04-30 02:59:35] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: That was GA
[2021-04-30 03:00:14] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: They still are hardcore on hallucinations so I never speak out about my psychic episodes
[2021-04-30 03:00:50] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: That's very frustrating
[2021-04-30 03:01:09] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: The law doesn’t care about mentally ill people
[2021-04-30 03:01:19] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I mean sometimes
[2021-04-30 03:01:24] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: But I’m the southern states
[2021-04-30 03:01:27] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: In
[2021-04-30 03:01:44] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: It’s very stigmatized
[2021-04-30 03:01:53] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: There are people that care though.
[2021-04-30 03:02:07] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Oh yea tons of people care
[2021-04-30 03:02:18] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: But the people who run the states I don’t think they do
[2021-04-30 03:02:25] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: But anyway I just asked this stuff bc even though I can function, I still wish I could get more professional help but I can't get it because they say I'm not high risk enough.
[2021-04-30 03:02:30] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: And definitely :>
[2021-04-30 03:02:48] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Outpatient!
[2021-04-30 03:02:51] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I did it
[2021-04-30 03:03:00] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Like therapy visits?
[2021-04-30 03:03:06] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: You can do it no matter what kind state you are in
[2021-04-30 03:03:12] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Not really
[2021-04-30 03:03:13] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: It’s group
[2021-04-30 03:03:22] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: With other people who have similar mindsets
[2021-04-30 03:03:25] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Ah, I should look into it then I suppose
[2021-04-30 03:03:30] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: It lasts for like a few weeks
[2021-04-30 03:03:37] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: They watch your progress
[2021-04-30 03:04:08] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: They have all kinds of ones
[2021-04-30 03:04:16] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Oh nvm I forgot ||quarantine|| ~_~
[2021-04-30 03:04:27] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I went to one during quarantine
[2021-04-30 03:04:28] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: But yeah maybe I could look into it if I get too bad
[2021-04-30 03:04:36] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Fr? Was it virtual?

[2021-04-30 03:04:48] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Buuuuut
[2021-04-30 03:05:06] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: It was a forced one... cause I just got diagnosed with bipolar and the hospital made me go
[2021-04-30 03:05:19] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: So idk if like the non-forced reg ones
[2021-04-30 03:05:32] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Are virtual
[2021-04-30 03:05:43] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Ours had to be in-person to make sure we weren’t doing drugs and stuff
[2021-04-30 03:05:54] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: See I'm really scared about all of this forcing stuff bc I know I'm not high risk so they might not take me, and if they do assess me and think I'm at risk enough, they might force me
[2021-04-30 03:06:06] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: It's like nfsbiihbv
[2021-04-30 03:06:52] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: They won’t force you to go, I was extremely manic! Like erratic. I didnt know it till I got there but I would talk about stuff that made absolutely no sense
[2021-04-30 03:07:00] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: You aren’t sucidal
[2021-04-30 03:07:04] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I was sucidal
[2021-04-30 03:07:23] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: You are over 18 too just sign yourself up
[2021-04-30 03:07:58] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: And honestly, if you really do meet a criteria to be forced into a psych ward. Maybe you need to go?
[2021-04-30 03:08:14] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: That's true
[2021-04-30 03:08:44] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I'm just so scared of that especially with my diabetes and then also my school and parents /_ \
[2021-04-30 03:08:56] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Oh shoot ur a senior still
[2021-04-30 03:09:23] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: if you have a pump you will be okay
[2021-04-30 03:09:49] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Plus since you are over 18 you control everything your parents can’t do anything
[2021-04-30 03:10:08] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: That's true
[2021-04-30 03:10:16] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: But the *social aspect*
[2021-04-30 03:10:19] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Yikes

[2021-04-30 03:11:21] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Nice!

[2021-04-30 03:12:01] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: But like
[2021-04-30 03:12:05] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Under control
[2021-04-30 03:12:35] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Hey, you know, I'm chill with most people so even though I *feel* antisocial I almost always chat with everybody at a place
[2021-04-30 03:12:45] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Same lol
[2021-04-30 03:12:55] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: When I’m uncomfortable I break out of my shell
[2021-04-30 03:13:23] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: XD glad I'm not the only one hehe
[2021-04-30 03:13:36] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Although I do, ironically, love people
[2021-04-30 03:13:48] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: The pains of an anxious extrovert rofl

[2021-04-30 03:15:13] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I’m gonna go to bed
[2021-04-30 03:15:34] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Well, I think I'm gonna head to bed now bc I was originally gonna go to sleep earlier, but I'll go ahead and sleep now. I appreciate the chat, and I probably won't go to outpatient, but I will keep it in mind for the times when it really gets bad. I always get nervous that I'm taking everything too seriously, but that might be bc of my previous experiences with hypochondria/
[2021-04-30 03:15:39] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Same XD
[2021-04-30 03:16:20] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Good night, and I appreciate it! I don't have any resources irl for this stuff, lol
[2021-04-30 03:17:31] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Night!

[2021-04-30 10:05:35] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: See a doctor we are not doctors don’t self diagnose
[2021-04-30 10:07:57] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: I do get hypomanic a fair bit but I spend most of my time depressed
[2021-04-30 10:08:04] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: Cause I have bipolar II
[2021-04-30 10:10:07] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: Hypomania for me also usually manifests as agitation over euphoria. Don’t get me wrong euphoria is part of it but a lot of the time my energy goes to being angry and pissed off over being Euphoric
[2021-04-30 10:10:22] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: Occasionally it’ll also manifest ||as hypersexuality||
[2021-04-30 10:12:15] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: The worst moments are when the agitation and energy and restlessness of hypomania combine with depression to create the worst experience ever
[2021-04-30 10:14:58] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: But again, I’d say for every hypomanic episode I have, I have two or three times as much depression to boot
[2021-04-30 10:15:25] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: Depressive episodes are honestly just like, a part of my daily rhythm I’ve scheduled my life around trying to avoid dealing with them
[2021-04-30 10:16:05] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: My depression lasts anywhere from 3 days to a month usually
[2021-04-30 10:16:14] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: My hypomania has never lasted longer than a week
[2021-04-30 10:16:22] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: Mixed episodes last about a week usually
[2021-04-30 10:16:43] (647127214797750272) french duck#5234: I know i will
[2021-04-30 10:16:50] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: Okay good
[2021-04-30 10:17:04] (647127214797750272) french duck#5234: I need to see a doctor to know
[2021-04-30 10:18:24] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: Oh yeah mixed episodes are also almost always a guaranteed delusional moment, funny fresh 3 am paranoia is funny and good
