[2021-04-28 20:35:25] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: <@746038046310531084> hey hey <:CuteHap:753811556793581608>  I made this ticket just to kinda help out and clarify just to kinda give you a heads up going forward not only for the server but just in general. And this isn’t me like yelling at you or nothing like that so please don’t take it that way ❤️  to be called ||”it”|| is very, demeaning. It’s very rude and not proper for anyone to really be called that, and at times, by many, it’s even seen as ||transphobic||. So just giving you the heads up to just be really cognizant if you can of that:) I don’t want anyone here in the server feeling unwelcome being themselves you know?
