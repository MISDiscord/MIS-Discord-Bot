[2021-04-14 16:02:01] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: mhm, that sounds very scary to have to live with

[2021-04-14 16:04:23] (539795114181001226) Samin_Wasif#1639: I dont know what or where i can or could go and when i say the i dont mean the hopeless kind i mean it as in like i see a future that is just abuse. no one will accept me who i m wit m flaws
[2021-04-14 16:05:23] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: I understand that, it can be really hard. Your roles say 16-17, are you planning on going to uni?
[2021-04-14 16:05:39] (539795114181001226) Samin_Wasif#1639: yes
[2021-04-14 16:07:45] (539795114181001226) Samin_Wasif#1639: thing is, i dont have the best grades and i want to do good i know i can its just that i have a life long history with these people and its hard to imagine myself with out them
[2021-04-14 16:09:29] (539795114181001226) Samin_Wasif#1639: there abuse lead me towards having a bad porn addiction, and after all that trauma i am just in a cycle of wondering if i am a good person or not
[2021-04-14 16:11:40] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: Its hard when its family abuse, but from personal experience, its hard at first but it really does get better without them, plus there are charities and people that can help you leave an abusive situation.
[2021-04-14 16:15:23] (539795114181001226) Samin_Wasif#1639: its confusing emotionally like i have never really had anyone who never really loveed me for who i am
[2021-04-14 16:15:36] (539795114181001226) Samin_Wasif#1639: so moving on is personally hard for me
[2021-04-14 16:17:13] (539795114181001226) Samin_Wasif#1639: sorry for taking such a long time to write these thing. it just takes a while for me to think what i want to say
[2021-04-14 16:18:45] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: It's okay, take all the time you need, i'll be here. Someone will love you for who you are, i know it doesnt seem like it, but first youve got to help yourself, esp by getting out of an abusive situation. It isnt safe for you to stay there and get abused,
[2021-04-14 16:19:18] (539795114181001226) Samin_Wasif#1639: ik
[2021-04-14 16:21:03] (539795114181001226) Samin_Wasif#1639: I want to be a good human but i sometimes act out of rage in some situations. it just makes me question my life and stuff
[2021-04-14 16:23:31] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: in times of rage, it‚Äôs helpful to try and remove yourself from the situation and practice some breathing techniques
[2021-04-14 16:24:21] (539795114181001226) Samin_Wasif#1639: alright i'll try that
[2021-04-14 16:25:37] (539795114181001226) Samin_Wasif#1639: i really haven't felt human in a while so thank you for talking to me about my problems.
