Anything you say in the <#830171012199874600> will remain anonymous to other members :)
[2021-04-11 17:56:37] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: Hey <@&705596937201516544>. This is announcement is just to bring everyone up to speed on some things going on behind the scenes regarding server events. 

Firstly, we would like to thank you all for participating in the events so far and for making them enjoyable each time. However I would like to ask that we don't hold any unofficial events like movie nights or quiz nights. You are free to play games with others in VC (obviously as long as its appropriate and abides by server rules) but for things like movies and quizzes a lot of effort goes into the organisation of them to make sure everyone is well informed so that everyone is safe and unofficial events can mess around with the behind the scenes organisation of said events. This is all so that everyone stays safe so we hope you understand. 

Secondly, I would like to have a set day for our weekly events so in the next message in this channel you will see a poll and I would like for you to vote for whichever day suits you best in a normal week. 

Thirdly, we're always looking for suggestions for games, movies and quiz topics so feel free to DM me <@!543871424188907544> with any suggestions.

**REMINDER** We have private support applications open so go ahead and apply by filling out this form: https://forms.gle/CA8o3ojZTTRAMokTA

Hello! This is an announcement on the focus of adding new mods to the r/mentalillness moderation team please apply for the team if you are interested. Two of the requirements of applying for mod is knowing our rules and being **16+**

We are specifically looking for mods from any areas that are not in the time zone BST or in the time zone EST because we have a lot of these already, thank you for everyone that has applied previously 

Please see the link below for the application https://tinyurl.com/modappmentalillness (just a clarification for people who might be worried we cannot see your email address when you apply)

If you need us to copy your id for you please put a message in <#826478320472293407>
[2021-04-15 19:51:03] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Sorry for the follow up announcement; we just wanted to clarify as well that we ask members to not go directly to mods asking about the status of their application, as that is not information we are able to disclose. Rather than having specific "application times", this link is perpetually open, meaning you are free to apply at any time. With that being said, we also do not have set deadlines or a quota of new members to add to the team, and therefore process applicants on a rolling basis, only promoting additional staff after the team has come to a consensus, and we feel that the member would fit in well. If you are chosen, we will privately reach out to you to confirm you are still interested, and then proceed from there, but otherwise, please do not message the mods about it.

[2021-04-17 15:26:24] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: Hey <@&704122324777042020> !

[2021-04-18 20:30:26] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: Hello @everyone 

Just taking a moment here to wish the server a Happy Birthday! 
 
We are officially one year old and opened our server 365 days ago. Since then we have been through many changes to become the best we can be. 

Join me in thanking the team for working so hard each day to keep us up and running!

And a massive thank you to you guys for making it into the server we know and love.
