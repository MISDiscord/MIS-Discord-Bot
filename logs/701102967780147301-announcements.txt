Anything you say in the <#830171012199874600> will remain anonymous to other members :)
[2021-04-11 17:56:37] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: Hey <@&705596937201516544>. This is announcement is just to bring everyone up to speed on some things going on behind the scenes regarding server events. 

Firstly, we would like to thank you all for participating in the events so far and for making them enjoyable each time. However I would like to ask that we don't hold any unofficial events like movie nights or quiz nights. You are free to play games with others in VC (obviously as long as its appropriate and abides by server rules) but for things like movies and quizzes a lot of effort goes into the organisation of them to make sure everyone is well informed so that everyone is safe and unofficial events can mess around with the behind the scenes organisation of said events. This is all so that everyone stays safe so we hope you understand. 

Secondly, I would like to have a set day for our weekly events so in the next message in this channel you will see a poll and I would like for you to vote for whichever day suits you best in a normal week. 

Thirdly, we're always looking for suggestions for games, movies and quiz topics so feel free to DM me <@!543871424188907544> with any suggestions.

**REMINDER** We have private support applications open so go ahead and apply by filling out this form: https://forms.gle/CA8o3ojZTTRAMokTA
