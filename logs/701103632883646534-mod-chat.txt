[2021-04-08 21:24:21] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: ok i've entirely refreshed the logs so it'll start recording now
[2021-04-08 21:24:53] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: and you can pull the last n messages from any channel with /channellogs <amount> #channel-mention
[2021-04-08 21:24:59] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: and it'll include stuff that's been deleted
[2021-04-08 21:25:37] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: i maxed it out so you can't request more than 1,000 messages just so the command doesnt take too long if there's a typo or something and you do too many
[2021-04-08 21:25:47] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: i can up the limit but if you want like the *entire* file just lmk and i can grab it from the server
[2021-04-08 21:26:35] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: also if you want a shorter command feel free to suggest an alias
[2021-04-08 21:27:03] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: maybe just /logs <amount> channel mention
[2021-04-08 21:27:09] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: sounds good
[2021-04-08 21:28:22] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: but we should never need more than 1000
[2021-04-08 21:30:00] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: /logs 200 <#701103632883646534>
[2021-04-08 21:30:07] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: ok cool you can use /logs now
[2021-04-08 21:30:11] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: and yeah i figured 1000 is a good number
[2021-04-08 21:46:42] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: <@!516313738588979210> ya know flourish is struggling? well sy is, ive been talking to her about some different stuff, mainly events, so i was wondering if <@!543871424188907544> once their revamp is over, you do such an amazing job here, to help out over there and help that get up and running, ofc you're welcome to say no and it wouldnt be until sy has figured out what she's doing with the server
[2021-04-08 21:49:44] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: i dont mind doing that, but thats certainly something i cant do on my own
[2021-04-08 21:50:01] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: as long as a small team can be made im in
[2021-04-08 21:50:22] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: even if its just one or two more people alongside me
[2021-04-08 21:51:41] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i’d definitely help you out with it, and hopefully the owner is looking about bringing new staff in, so they’d be able to help out too, it’s just a rough idea, i hate to see such a nice server go to waste, and she’s really struggling bless her
[2021-04-08 21:52:10] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: yeah im totally down to do it
[2021-04-08 21:55:49] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: *what should i do about the two support tickets*
[2021-04-08 21:56:57] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: close caplo's they probably forgot about that and dont need it, if they do they can file a new one
[2021-04-08 21:57:07] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: and for ashy boi's maybe just ping them?
[2021-04-08 21:57:15] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: it’s been over 24hrs
[2021-04-08 21:57:33] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i’ll add something into the rules about keeping it open for 24hrs and then it getting closed
[2021-04-08 21:57:59] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i’m also gonna write up a rule list for people using the system of what they can expect ect
[2021-04-08 21:58:06] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: someone remind me about that if i don’t do it
[2021-04-08 21:58:42] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: can you also add that you can’t ping private support if they don’t get to your ticket asap
[2021-04-08 21:59:12] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: absolutely
[2021-04-08 21:59:16] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: thank you
[2021-04-08 21:59:20] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: it’s in the top of the ticket but people can’t read
[2021-04-08 22:00:25] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah i know
[2021-04-08 22:00:46] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: im talking to sy about this rn
[2021-04-08 22:00:59] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: instead of $verify we should make people upload scores from online literacy tests /s
[2021-04-08 22:01:08] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: make a list in <#801504927947554876> of anything you want me to include
[2021-04-08 22:01:17] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: lmaoo lily would fail
[2021-04-08 22:01:27] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: so would i if we're being honest lmao
[2021-04-08 22:01:52] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: i set my bag of food down apparently it was unbalanced and fell
[2021-04-08 22:02:03] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: i spent the last 10 minutes cleaning up french fry crumbs and soda
[2021-04-08 22:04:53] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: <@!184040294851936256> go careful with med talk, bet ya there’s gonna ask for recommendations
[2021-04-08 22:05:26] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah i’m aware
[2021-04-08 22:20:36] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: is it ok that beth was telling people to stop typing in the chat
[2021-04-08 22:21:18] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: i don't really think so
[2021-04-08 22:21:19] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: cause in imo that was disrespectful to everyone else in the chat
[2021-04-08 22:21:22] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: ^
[2021-04-08 22:22:24] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: well i mean people are allowed to say when somethings annoying rm
[2021-04-08 22:23:10] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: so i don’t think they did anything wrong
[2021-04-08 22:23:21] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: we’re you gonna warn em?
[2021-04-08 22:23:49] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: no but i don’t understand why they couldn’t mute the server if they don’t want to get notifications
[2021-04-08 22:24:26] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: maybe they just wanted to talk to people
[2021-04-08 22:26:05] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i mean they were rude but people were annoying them
[2021-04-08 22:26:43] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: b it's not your job to intentionally disagree just for the sake of "testing" people, we want to avoid unnecessary arguments not start them
[2021-04-08 22:27:53] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i’m not trying to start an argument, i’m trying to see if they’re confident enough to speak out when they think something is wrong
[2021-04-08 22:29:38] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: that's still not your job to see how confident they are. Jupiter was promoted because they've shown they're more than capable of handling themselves when complicated situations arise, you guys don't need to undergo constant tests and neither should they
[2021-04-08 22:31:41] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i’m well aware how capable they are michael, all of our new mods are. but the ability to speak out when you think something is wrong is an important one, of being able to have your own opinion and stand firm in your decision making process
[2021-04-08 22:33:10] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Which is exactly what I am doing right now, with a genuine disagreement, not something made up for the sake of seeing how you respond. I'm not saying that skill isn't important, I'm saying it's not your place to go around testing people to see if they can or not
[2021-04-08 22:34:11] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: I'm sorry that I didn't reply to your dm saying you were going to do this earlier, I was tabbed out
[2021-04-08 22:34:24] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: michael i appreciate that bee tries to push me to voice my opinion more. it’s definitely a big issue that i face and i would honestly label it my biggest flaw as a mod. i don’t think you have to get upset about this since it’s my decision whether i want to be challenged or not
[2021-04-08 22:34:52] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i appreciate the concern but i can handle it.
[2021-04-08 22:35:08] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: if it was too much, i would let you all know.
[2021-04-08 22:36:09] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Sorry, I didn't mean to come across as implying you couldn't handle it, my issue is with the idea, not that she's doing it to you specifically. Considering how many arguments and team drama has resulted from you doing things like this, I would've thought you would know better b, to just avoid it altogether
[2021-04-08 22:37:11] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: From previous experience with all that's happened here over the past year, we have absolutely no reason to uselessly invite opportunities for arguments, which is what it seems like you were expecting jupiter to do
[2021-04-08 22:37:38] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Which I am proud of you for handling well Jupiter
[2021-04-08 22:38:08] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: michael if you have a problem, feel free to dm me, but i will not engaging with you on this topic in this chat.
[2021-04-08 22:40:20] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: alright if you have anything more to add, you can message me, but I've said all that I need to. This was a team discussion which is why I put it here
[2021-04-09 03:42:24] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: can we please add a rule against pinging moderators if you're sad
[2021-04-09 03:48:06] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#7023: I’d like that rule too

I don’t even think I want to set anything but a note here for this case but I don’t think it even had foul play here but just in case it comes back up I’ll set note
[2021-04-09 05:57:19] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: Yeah that’s fair enough
[2021-04-09 06:03:03] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#7023: Bc like I know people joke and say things like “i have the big gay” or whatever but you can’t tell the tone what that specific member talks anyway so yeah lol

[2021-04-09 07:57:36] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: That’s a mute

[2021-04-09 08:19:43] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I’m gunna say this as a pre warning because I think this is a teaching kinda moment
[2021-04-09 08:20:05] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I’ve had a complaint because one of the users thinks you took too long to warn them and it made it feel kinda unjustified
[2021-04-09 08:20:36] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#7023: That’s on me not Jupe

[2021-04-09 08:21:18] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: that's fair however it takes time to get screenshots, delete everything that was not safe to be in the chats, then make all the warnings
[2021-04-09 08:21:21] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#7023: Jupe  was screen shotting Bc log wasn’t working

[2021-04-11 00:08:49] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: idk why people need to know how many strikes is too many, maybe just don't break the rules
[2021-04-11 00:08:51] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I was looking for it tho and thought it was in the rules for some reason and I’m like BRUH

[2021-04-11 01:09:20] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: yeah i just read that
[2021-04-11 01:09:26] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i literally just ask cause i want others opinions
[2021-04-11 01:09:52] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i personally don’t know enough around that to fully comment
[2021-04-11 01:10:32] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: we don’t usually deal with psychopathy as it can be dangerous or anything related to that
[2021-04-11 01:11:04] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: kinda prefer to be like go see your doctor
[2021-04-11 01:11:35] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah definitely
[2021-04-11 01:11:56] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: but if you’re more knowledgeable feel free to do as you see fit
[2021-04-11 01:12:46] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i’m just more worried since it does technically discuss faking a disorder
[2021-04-11 01:13:14] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: yeah that’s very true
[2021-04-11 01:13:28] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: you got this

[2021-04-11 01:20:29] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: thank you. they seem to be typing so imma just watch
[2021-04-11 01:21:10] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i'm just concerned since they talk about faking a disorder and have also been discussing how they could help people with their own problems since they're highly educated in psychology
[2021-04-11 01:22:30] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: also they mentioned in light that they were muted from another server for 7 days
[2021-04-11 01:34:56] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: moon just dmed me

[2021-04-11 01:38:58] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i don't understand why i'm getting dmed
[2021-04-11 01:39:12] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i'm just enforcing the rules of the server
[2021-04-11 01:39:25] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: it also kinda feels like they're wanting me to forgive them for it

[2021-04-11 01:51:43] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: yeah i’m sorry they did that, you handled it really well
[2021-04-11 01:52:16] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i guess they weren't happy with me not forgiving them and telling them to refrain from doing it again
[2021-04-11 01:59:00] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: we can’t please everyone unfortunately, but their guilt tripping is awful, so if they do return, ping me bc i’m not having people guilt trip amazinf staff trynna help
[2021-04-11 01:59:40] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: will do. i did not like getting guilt tripped twice by this person.
[2021-04-11 02:00:50] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: am no surprised, like it’s not your fault they can’t abide by the rules

[2021-04-11 12:26:19] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i’m not sure it’s a good idea due to everything gone on

[2021-04-11 12:28:56] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: but we don’t know which servers are close with them and which aren’t

[2021-04-11 13:05:05] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: oh gosh what’s happened
[2021-04-11 13:06:01] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: dkal had an unofficial movie night were they watched wall-e
[2021-04-11 13:06:13] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: *i was gonna use the old suggestions for next time*
[2021-04-11 13:06:35] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: my plan was to only ask for new suggestions when we've fallen to 3 old ones
[2021-04-11 13:06:47] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: if i take wall-e off then i have to ask for new suggestions
[2021-04-11 13:06:53] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: *its a mess now*
[2021-04-11 13:06:57] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: anyways
[2021-04-11 13:07:11] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: this is for next month me to figure out
[2021-04-11 13:07:23] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: maybe make an announcement saying only event staff can hold events and have to be approved by mods and users can’t do that
[2021-04-11 13:07:35] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: good idea
[2021-04-11 13:07:44] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: that’s really not fair for all the hard work you’ve put in
[2021-04-11 13:08:00] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: ill write up a draft later
[2021-04-11 13:08:15] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i’m putting out the support app later on if you wanna out them out together
[2021-04-11 13:08:17] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: there were a couple other event related things i needed to address too
[2021-04-11 13:08:35] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: ah if you’re is a big one i’ll do my own and i’ll post it in a couple days
[2021-04-11 13:08:37] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: do you have any planned time?
[2021-04-11 13:09:07] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: it shouldnt be that big and i can always just delay mine, yours is more urgent
[2021-04-11 13:09:44] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: nono it’s okay! if you want you can just pop a little message at the bottom of yours with a little link to the app
[2021-04-11 13:10:10] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: ok sure ill do that
[2021-04-11 13:10:29] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: ill probably write it up after i get some work done
[2021-04-11 13:11:15] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: no worries just give me a ping whenever if you need anything

[2021-04-11 13:16:55] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: <@!543871424188907544> have idea
[2021-04-11 13:17:01] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: What about
[2021-04-11 13:17:06] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Event helpers?
[2021-04-11 13:17:09] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: no
[2021-04-11 13:17:20] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: hahahahaha
[2021-04-11 13:17:21] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i love that
[2021-04-11 13:17:22] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: okie
[2021-04-11 13:17:23] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: i have a very particular way of doing events
[2021-04-11 13:17:30] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: i can only trust mods with it lmao
[2021-04-11 13:17:36] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: lol fairs
[2021-04-11 13:17:48] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: the most i can have the members do is give suggestions and participate
[2021-04-11 13:44:30] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i do think if the events get too big that it will be useful to have event helpers, but you do have the whole ass event team to help you with anything too
[2021-04-11 14:00:26] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: see just from organising things irl if it gets too big the leader has to be *extremely* on top of things and everybody else also needs to be on top of things and if something small fucks up the whole thing can come crashing down which is not what i want happening
[2021-04-11 14:00:45] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: and theres such a fine line between enough people and too many
[2021-04-11 14:01:23] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: i just dont want to risk anything and especially for what we are doing i doubt we'll ever need more than the three of us on the events team
[2021-04-11 14:01:55] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: another thing with it getting to big is then tasks are spread too thinly and one task would rely heavily on another and so on and so forth
[2021-04-11 14:02:54] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: at least with like what we did for the movie where i split the list into parts to get the tw list it was split into good chunks where there would be a level of consistency between each list
[2021-04-11 14:04:21] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Good point :)
[2021-04-11 14:04:45] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: then other than that im a control freak and feel like i need to have an iron grip on what i organise and keep everything as consistent as possible so having a bigger team would make it a lot harder then that same fear of it tumbling down comes into play again
[2021-04-11 14:05:00] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: i just dont want to have these events fail is all really
[2021-04-11 14:05:47] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Yeah you make a good point that’s understandable
[2021-04-11 14:05:55] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: :)
[2021-04-11 14:06:32] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: now that i have said all that i will make a list on how i organise events and stuff so that when exams roll around i dont have to worry about events
[2021-04-11 14:08:21] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: *the person that posted their key for emotes has kinda thrown it off*

[2021-04-11 19:50:37] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Okie
[2021-04-11 19:51:04] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: we can definitely discourage it and i think we should
[2021-04-11 19:51:36] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Dm support as in officially, or just two people talking to each other
[2021-04-11 19:53:41] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Idk what you all think but personally I don’t think official server dm support should be allowed either, cause it’s just extra risks and can’t be moderated. We could set up ticket tool to let two people open a private ticket room for themselves maybe?
[2021-04-11 19:57:22] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: i mean im pretty sure that people know who they're talking to and how much they can tell them
[2021-04-11 19:57:31] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: but better safe than sorry
[2021-04-11 19:59:46] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: it definitely would be better if users used the private support tickets
[2021-04-11 20:00:36] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: We could set up dm tickets?
[2021-04-11 20:01:16] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: that might not be a bad idea
[2021-04-11 20:01:25] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: seeing as so many people always ask to dm
[2021-04-11 20:04:57] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Also can I use today’s QOTD to do a welfare check type thing? What do you think?
[2021-04-11 20:06:07] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: sure go for it
[2021-04-11 20:06:44] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Okie
[2021-04-11 20:06:52] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Imma draft this one
[2021-04-11 20:07:32] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Actually nvm
[2021-04-11 20:07:38] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Let’s just do something else
[2021-04-11 20:08:39] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: you sure you dont wanna?
[2021-04-11 20:08:56] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: why do people open tickets and then close them right after
[2021-04-11 20:09:04] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Yeah it’s fine
[2021-04-11 20:09:22] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2021-04-11 20:09:41] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: How does “what’s the last tv show/movie/book you last watched/read? “
[2021-04-11 20:09:56] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: that’s good
[2021-04-11 20:10:16] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: looks good
[2021-04-11 20:10:57] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: also i think the second to last anon confession should have been censored
[2021-04-11 20:11:35] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: *but how do we tell them*
[2021-04-11 20:13:30] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: oh you delete it and then say “remember that references to ||suicide|| must be censored even in anon confessions”
[2021-04-11 20:13:45] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: hold up i can do it
[2021-04-11 20:13:53] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: ye ho ahead
[2021-04-11 20:13:56] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i have enough energy to do this rn
[2021-04-11 20:14:15] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: you dont gotta i could do it
[2021-04-11 20:15:07] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: What do you think about a ticket system where members can add people to do have a dm support session? That’s kinda removing dm support ig?
[2021-04-11 20:15:18] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: done :)
[2021-04-11 20:15:19] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: But that’s just private support without selected supporters
[2021-04-11 20:15:47] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: then what’s the need for private support
[2021-04-11 20:15:54] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: i kinda think that feels like its complicating things
[2021-04-11 20:16:05] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Okay
[2021-04-11 20:16:41] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: we could leave reminder about server rules and reporting odd actions
[2021-04-11 20:18:38] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: in my opinion, private support is already used way less than pinging support. adding dm support to the server would completely diminish the need for private support. also i think the reason people are so hesitant about private support is because they're under the assumption that private support handles things like ||suicide threats||
[2021-04-11 20:18:58] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: as a kind of last resort we could remove the need to apply to be a supporter and just have the support role but that would remove a lot of the confidentiality and it would be a lot more work to moderate and keep in check
[2021-04-11 20:19:40] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: before i go live with the expectations i can add in a little about what they actually support with so it could open it up
[2021-04-11 20:20:28] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: What about a vetting process for supports instead of an application one?
[2021-04-11 20:20:54] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i think that might be a good idea because i was talking to some members and they were under the assumption that private support handled the more intense stuff
[2021-04-11 20:21:11] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: how so?
[2021-04-11 20:22:10] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Like for example if we put out an announcement saying “react with [emote] if you’d like to be a private supporter” then we could go through the people who react and just say who we don’t like?
[2021-04-11 20:22:36] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: honestly i think an interview process would be a good idea.
[2021-04-11 20:22:54] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i know it's tedious but it would give us an idea of how they do under pressure
[2021-04-11 20:24:03] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i know a few servers have like practice situations to apply for supporters, we could try something like that
[2021-04-11 20:24:22] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah agreed
[2021-04-11 20:25:04] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i'd be more than happy to run any simulations
[2021-04-11 20:25:19] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: ^^ me too
[2021-04-11 20:25:43] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: ~~i think it would be kinda fun~~
[2021-04-11 20:26:06] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: >.>
[2021-04-11 20:26:12] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: we could have a set simulation that runs through what a ticket can look like and have them send the answers into a ticket saying they want to apply
[2021-04-11 20:27:42] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: oh like there's prompts that the user gets and they have to say how they would respond.
[2021-04-11 20:27:59] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: but like instead of being situational, they get like actual details that make it look like a real convo?
[2021-04-11 20:28:41] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Might wanna highlight that’s it’s pretty much like in server support in public channels just in private
[2021-04-11 20:28:58] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: yeah, if we’re unhappy with answers we can always go in and create more scenarios
[2021-04-11 20:30:05] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i think it would be good if we ended the simulation with a situation that where it would needed to ping the moderators
[2021-04-11 20:30:28] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: just because i would want to see if they would follow those rules
[2021-04-11 20:30:55] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: is that better?
[2021-04-11 20:31:18] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: yeah deffo, if y’all are around tomorrow we can hop on a call and set it up, i’m a little too drained to do it tonight
[2021-04-11 20:32:38] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: lil i know you’re great with creating scenarios so i’d be greatful if you could join in and jupiter you’re just amazing with support and you could make a kind of guide? of how it would be answered in that situation if that’s okay
[2021-04-11 20:32:48] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: and anyone else’s input is really like
[2021-04-11 20:32:58] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah ofc
[2021-04-11 20:33:02] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i hope you feel better

[2021-04-12 00:31:56] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I hope that “clarifies” his ignorance:)
[2021-04-12 00:32:26] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: uh can you look at the support ticket
[2021-04-12 00:33:09] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Tbh I might just fucking strike Kira for the disrespect to mod thing too lol

[2021-04-12 00:33:37] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: tbh it does say the reason for the mute
[2021-04-12 00:33:55] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah you mind taking over the support ticket and i'll take over the kira ticket
[2021-04-12 00:34:19] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: No, I think notes it says 6 strikes put  the dancing coffin dead chat gif in light chat
[2021-04-12 00:34:34] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: People warned him too about that specific gif
[2021-04-12 00:34:48] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: ok but the 5 strikes were from me
[2021-04-12 00:35:07] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Yes
[2021-04-12 00:35:16] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: If you remember too I think that was the day it was just us online
[2021-04-12 00:35:22] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yes it was
[2021-04-12 00:36:07] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: So here’s my question I think I want to ask for all <@&793917061243994134> ... stacking of strikes. If you also remember I was kinda like not sure exactly if we can do that or not  and it just so happens to be coming up now it seems in that ticket
[2021-04-12 00:36:26] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yes we stack strikes
[2021-04-12 00:36:26] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Question to answer as a group: is stacking strikes allowed ?
[2021-04-12 00:36:29] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yes
[2021-04-12 00:36:34] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Yes I agree too
[2021-04-12 00:37:05] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: It’s not written anywhere but it seems pretty like orthodox like that’s what you’re suppose to do
[2021-04-12 00:38:58] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: <@!184040294851936256> I bet you a firm handshake that this person is gonna say their torture was a bdsm personal thing not related to the ticket
[2021-04-12 00:39:24] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i-
[2021-04-12 00:39:38] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: para they're under 16
[2021-04-12 00:42:39] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: OH I didn’t check roles <:eyes2:753414470516211792>
[2021-04-12 00:42:59] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Uh... why on earth is she getting tortured then..... wtf
[2021-04-12 00:43:17] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: That’s uh.... scary
[2021-04-12 00:43:33] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: not kira saying that we can close the ticket
[2021-04-12 00:44:04] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Disrespectful af
[2021-04-12 00:44:31] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: It annoys me too Bc it’s clear cut like zero gray area on his mute
[2021-04-12 00:44:38] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: And they’re act like they
[2021-04-12 00:44:45] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: .. whatever lol
[2021-04-12 01:06:59] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: <@!200391976837840896> thoughts on kicking kira?
[2021-04-12 01:07:24] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: wait might be late
[2021-04-12 01:07:30] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: <@!222479899808628736> get in here and speak
[2021-04-12 01:07:31] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I don’t mind
[2021-04-12 01:07:58] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: i'm not at all against it
[2021-04-12 01:08:05] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: they deserve it in my opinion too
[2021-04-12 01:08:17] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: just might be late right cause we already talked to them
[2021-04-12 01:08:46] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I think they’re disrespectful and they don’t care about the rules and show 0 empathy for it. Don’t want to hear it don’t wanna be bothered to hear it why they got muted, in their mind we’re the enemy Bc were mods and ruined his fun
[2021-04-12 01:08:50] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: yeah that's the only reason i'd be hesitant but then again if they don't seem like they're gonna stop doing what they were after the mute is up, no reason to keep them around
[2021-04-12 01:08:54] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: yeha ^
[2021-04-12 01:08:54] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: That’s how they see it lmao
[2021-04-12 01:09:23] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: im am disappearing to go get noodles but i will try to somewhat stay caught up
[2021-04-12 01:09:25] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah but they're at 6 strikes and they would get either 2 or 3 strikes depending on the rule
[2021-04-12 01:09:36] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: so they would be kicked either way
[2021-04-12 01:10:20] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: <@!200391976837840896> wanna do the honors then
[2021-04-12 01:18:59] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I’ll kick them but are are just kicking them because they have more warnings that need to be issues or kicking them because they seemed to not care about our mod ticket ?
[2021-04-12 01:19:18] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: cause they have more strikes
[2021-04-12 01:19:26] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Because I want to be sure that even though we want to kick them they’re k Kicking  them for a kicksble reason
[2021-04-12 01:19:41] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: With the daddy issues thing I’m assuming ?
[2021-04-12 01:21:04] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yes for being disrespectful to mods
[2021-04-12 01:22:34] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Indeed. Is it just ?kick
[2021-04-12 01:22:42] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Or manually through discord itself
[2021-04-12 01:22:51] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: I think both work
[2021-04-12 01:23:00] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: this feels way too late to do now
[2021-04-12 01:23:40] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I’ll give him a warn then for the convo then
[2021-04-12 01:24:16] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: And I’m always a fan of timing doesn’t matter. If someone does something wrong and mods discuss it doesn’t have to be without a time frame but that’s my opinion
[2021-04-12 01:27:45] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i think we should kick since he broke a rule
[2021-04-12 01:29:49] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Kicked
[2021-04-12 01:31:31] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: wait I was a bit confused earlier but I just found and read through the ticket that person being tortured?
[2021-04-12 01:31:49] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: we believe them right
[2021-04-12 01:31:53] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Yeah.. by their cousin
[2021-04-12 01:33:11] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I mean I have no reason not to but that entire story was just odd. I can’t confirm nor deny if it’s true obviously but I’ll believe it is
[2021-04-12 01:33:30] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: kira rejoined
[2021-04-12 01:33:39] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: <@!222479899808628736> what do we do in that situation
[2021-04-12 01:33:53] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: I would ignore it for now and wait for them to do something to break the rules or start going off on us
[2021-04-12 01:33:56] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: then just ban and be done with them
[2021-04-12 01:34:10] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: we'll wait
[2021-04-12 01:35:35] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: also what do you think of reporting those messages in the ticket to discord, and letting them handle it? it's not extremely likely that they will do anything, but I know they have before and I think we need to at least let them know
[2021-04-12 01:36:06] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Since they obviously have access to the personal details of the account and can get authorities involved if needed, I'm not sure how serious it is. I've only ever done that once so I don't know how often they actually intervene
[2021-04-12 01:41:59] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: idk
[2021-04-12 01:43:07] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i'll read this soon
[2021-04-12 01:43:14] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: my friend is ranting
[2021-04-12 01:43:35] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: no worries
[2021-04-12 01:44:29] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i would deffo report it to discord and any other situations where we believe someone is in active danger
[2021-04-12 01:44:44] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: oh you mean the support ticket
[2021-04-12 01:44:46] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yes agreed
[2021-04-12 01:45:20] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: sorry that’s my fault for not making the clear from the start
[2021-04-12 01:46:39] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: as much as we want to help, we’re not and we can do more damage in those situations, by all means, be there for the users, but report it to discord
[2021-04-12 01:46:50] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: do you want to make the report <@!200391976837840896> since you were more actively involved? it's ok if not, I can do it
[2021-04-12 01:47:08] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: I can send you the link you just log in with your account and there's like a dropdown where you click the type of report you're making
[2021-04-12 01:47:39] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Also we need to be sure to not delete the ticket, discord won't do anything if the messages aren't physically there. We can log it but the channel has to be visible
[2021-04-12 01:47:45] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Report to discord ?
[2021-04-12 01:47:48] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: yeah
[2021-04-12 01:48:04] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Sure
[2021-04-12 01:48:26] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Sorry I’m doing a dm support and ticket support and at my grandparents but indeed I can do it:)
[2021-04-12 01:49:11] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: no don't worry, it doesn't have to be immediate or anything, take your time lol
[2021-04-12 01:49:19] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: they take a couple days to get back, it's not like instant replies
[2021-04-12 01:49:32] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: probably won't even look today cause it's sunday
[2021-04-12 01:49:56] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new - this is the link you just sign in with your discord account
[2021-04-12 01:50:27] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: if you need any help with anything lmk i just woke up so imma be awake now and don’t want you too busy when you’re trynna spend time at your grandparents
[2021-04-12 02:04:33] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I can do this tonight or tomorrow morning then:)
[2021-04-12 02:04:37] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Thanks
[2021-04-12 02:05:05] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: And nah my nana is sleeping it’s just my pop and I watching a movie together
[2021-04-12 02:07:26] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: aww, that’s really nice
[2021-04-12 02:08:05] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I’m over there 3-4 times a week usually
[2021-04-12 02:08:22] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I’m very close with them, they helped me when my I got taken away
[2021-04-12 02:09:25] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i’m really glad you have them so close <a:hugs:801846621183803452>
[2021-04-12 02:10:37] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: My pop is practically like a father to me. He *is* my father in my eyes. Same as my nana is my mother. They helped raise me and do a lot for me in my life time
[2021-04-12 02:12:58] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: they seem like really great people and they’ve raised a great kid
[2021-04-12 03:49:47] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: <@!200391976837840896>
[2021-04-12 03:49:56] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: check light general
[2021-04-12 04:02:38] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: para he should be banned
[2021-04-12 04:02:41] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: end of story
[2021-04-12 04:04:25] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I might just ban him and be done with it
[2021-04-12 04:05:13] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: ban him and move on
[2021-04-12 04:05:59] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I did
[2021-04-12 04:06:10] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: ok cool
[2021-04-12 04:09:52] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I banned him, he was being disruptive and kept trying to challenge the mod decision and strike system. He was trying to convince members we did not fairly treat him regarding strikes, I sent a message to light channel stating exactly what happened and the fact that he can be here if he acts appropriately. Things got a little feisty in light general which I did not want to happen. I banned him, purged channel of the last 40 messages regarding all that
[2021-04-12 04:24:36] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: <@&793917061243994134> please review my ban and stuff I believe Jupiter doesn’t agree with what I did but I’ll let everyone else including Jupiter decide and discuss
[2021-04-12 05:07:14] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: I know that i'm a bit on the harsher side, but I personally would've just banned him from the start too. It's not really a "bad" thing to justify ourselves to the server and try to be lenient to an extent, but we also have no obligation to do that, and it's usually pretty obvious to everyone else in the server when a random person is just making up bs comments to try to get on our nerves or test the rules. Assuming I'm understanding the question correctly, that's kind of my view on it, I would've just banned as soon as they started arguing immediately after coming back, we don't need to put up with it
[2021-04-12 05:07:42] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: I don't think you did anything wrong either though, it's just a difference in modding styles, as long as nothing gets too out of hand both are perfectly fine
[2021-04-12 05:09:13] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Also off topic, it was probably an accident since we normally just are in the habit of closing tickets as soon as the person doesn't need it anymore, but since the one about the person being tortured was closed, Discord won't do anything about it because of their privacy policy, even if we have the logs
[2021-04-12 05:09:40] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: As soon as a message gets deleted from the physical chat or the channel disappears, they'll refuse to consider anything that was said there
[2021-04-12 05:12:05] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: ah shit
[2021-04-12 05:13:26] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: another off topic thing but i'm quite irritated that the jake person keeps asking if anyone has tried this treatment and then slanders meds
[2021-04-12 05:15:48] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Yeah I saw what he said in light general when Jupe pinged me about it, to me I wanted to at least give him one last chance because he did join back after being kicked I wanted to give him one last chance to prove he wanted to be here. He stated right when he joined that he was mistreated and wrongfullly muted and essentially telling 1000 + members private information and it shows distrust of mods. I answered explaining the entire situation from having 6 strikes to being disrespectful to mods in bot command as well as stating that he was even brought to handle this in private and still didn’t. I didn’t want 1000+ members thinking oh shit this dudes telling us not to trust mods and then just got banned. So I explained That to him and essentially asked him if he’s here for the right reasons. I stated clear that if he acts appropriately he can stay. He said again he was wrongfully accused, I said I can provide screen shots of what he sent if he wanted. Members started to then get involve, this is something 1000% I didn’t want to happen but Jupe was on it quick and told them to stop as well as I did. At that point I banned as he continued to go on, I immediately purged the chat to bring back normalcy (I also now know that purging chat apparently does NOT save the chat <:kannasleep:757244149593538710>  I raise my hand and claim blame for that 10000% my fault)
[2021-04-12 05:17:20] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I didn’t close that one but I did ask if she wanted me to close it but I don’t think I saw a response and then it was closed. Could be my bad for insinuating a close ticket was necessary
[2021-04-12 05:18:29] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: actually it's my bad for closing the ticket

[2021-04-12 05:44:15] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i don’t know if that was a censored word or not allowed

The word meds does not need to be spoilered but as soon as you go into specifics about what the medication is or the name of it, it requires spoilers such as ||pain meds|| or ||benzodiazepines||.

To spoiler something, place \|\| on either side of the word or phrase you wish to censor. If you fail to spoiler mark something, you will be asked to do so and potentially warned. Failure to properly censor on multiple occasions will result in a ban.

[2021-04-12 21:56:59] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: I think it's a reasonable rule to add that we don't want people doing dm support, if we can find a way to let users create one on one tickets with each other
[2021-04-12 22:09:50] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: That would lose us a lot I think tbh

[2021-04-14 16:57:42] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i can’t remember voices so i can’t pinpoint who said what
[2021-04-14 16:58:14] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: *time to bring them in for questioning?*

[2021-04-14 16:59:10] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: all those people said something
[2021-04-14 16:59:28] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: *all of them made inappropriate jokes?*
[2021-04-14 16:59:35] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: whether discussing mental health too seriously in a light vc or joking inappropriately
[2021-04-14 16:59:55] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: they all were talking about nsfw stuff that i know
[2021-04-14 16:59:56] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I thought discussing mh was fine in vc?
[2021-04-14 17:00:04] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: oh yeah that’s not appropriate
[2021-04-14 17:00:11] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah but like suicide
[2021-04-14 17:00:28] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i think with voice channels being used more we need to put out an announcement
[2021-04-14 17:00:32] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: yeah
[2021-04-14 17:00:39] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: but i deffo think all those that said something would be punish
[2021-04-14 17:00:43] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: we need to solidify rules about vc
[2021-04-14 17:00:49] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Yeah we need to
[2021-04-14 17:00:57] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: like spoiler list for example
[2021-04-14 17:01:09] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: *these two mention death a lot*
[2021-04-14 17:01:30] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: vc ended
[2021-04-14 17:01:33] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: idk why

[2021-04-14 17:01:45] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i’m really sorry for not remembering who said what
[2021-04-14 17:01:50] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: no it’s okay’
[2021-04-14 17:01:54] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: don’t worry
[2021-04-14 17:02:05] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: I think they should get more of a heavy warning for now because I and probably other people were under the impression voice chats were a bit more relaxed specifically because there’s no like “message history” so as long as everyone in the call is fine with it, it’s not as big of a problem
[2021-04-14 17:02:17] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: But yeah if they said that stuff it’s definitely a bit far over the line
[2021-04-14 17:02:30] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: but i’ve verbally warned twice
[2021-04-14 17:02:37] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: and it’s continuing
[2021-04-14 17:02:42] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Oh in that case yeah ignore me lol
[2021-04-14 17:02:49] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: If you’ve already warned them that’s different
[2021-04-14 17:02:51] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: yeah they need to be punished then
[2021-04-14 17:02:57] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: What do you wanna do Jupiter?
[2021-04-14 17:03:34] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: hhhh idk

[2021-04-14 17:04:11] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Sure :)
[2021-04-14 17:05:04] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i’m sorry i just saw some people who hurt me a lot in the past
[2021-04-14 17:47:25] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: sorry i'm back
[2021-04-14 17:47:29] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i had therapy
[2021-04-14 17:48:48] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i think we should make an announcement regarding the rules of vc
[2021-04-14 17:49:42] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: because if we have it specifically stated somewhere what isn't allowed in vc then there can't be any arguing regarding them breaking the rules
[2021-04-14 17:49:53] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: yeah definitely
[2021-04-14 17:50:06] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: also i think the punishment for breaking vc rules should be stricter than chat rules
[2021-04-14 17:50:24] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: and also that we should encourage people to file a ticket if someone does break the rules
[2021-04-14 17:51:21] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: it's just hard because there isn't a record of what is said in vc so people feel like they can get away with things
[2021-04-14 17:53:01] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: mhmm
[2021-04-14 17:53:13] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: does that sound ok?
[2021-04-14 17:53:28] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: sounds all good to me
