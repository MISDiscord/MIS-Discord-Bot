[2021-04-15 22:02:42] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: it’s natural to feel concern or worry for the people you are for
[2021-04-15 22:02:53] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: I know
[2021-04-15 22:03:11] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: im still worried tho and its just hard
[2021-04-15 22:04:28] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: mhms i get it! i’m an older sibling myself and i always am worried for my younger siblings
[2021-04-15 22:04:51] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: if they aren’t in any danger a method i recommend is fact checking
[2021-04-15 22:05:03] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: Whats that?
[2021-04-15 22:06:55] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: it’s repeating facts to help calm yourself. 

for example, i am currently away from home and worried for my younger sibling. a fact check would look like “i know they are safe” “i can call them at anytime” “if they need something they’d ask for it”
[2021-04-15 22:07:26] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: reminding yourself certain things to let go over a bad mindset and move on with a couple things
