I had four little boards and two of them fell a few days ago. One of them just fell off the wall and I'm not sure why, but for some reason it really hurts my mental state when they fall. I only have one left on my wall and I haven't been able to bring myself to hang them back up. Sorry if this is in the wrong channel, it's just really frustrating how quickly my mood changed.
