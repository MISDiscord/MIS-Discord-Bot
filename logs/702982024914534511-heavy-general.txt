[2021-04-09 17:14:33] (698719918836809738) consistantlyconfused#6794: I have these vision boards that my ||therapist|| suggested I make and they've been really helpful, but the adhesive I used to hang them up is wearing. I had four little boards and two of them fell a few days ago. One of them just fell off the wall and I'm not sure why, but for some reason it really hurts my mental state when they fall. I only have one left on my wall and I haven't been able to bring myself to hang them back up. Sorry if this is in the wrong channel, it's just really frustrating how quickly my mood changed.

[2021-04-11 03:52:28] (796641918460231732) ElonMuskQuant#2362: Today, I learned after a screaming suicide attempt again from my mom that my dad never wanted to see me or associate him with me. My parents got divorced after an emotionally abusive marriage and my father forbids me to see my grandparents and only saw me when he was getting in trouble with his new wife. He signed custody away from me and never wanted to see me and only did after his parents screamed at him. I also learned when I needed surgery when I was 12 bc I may had a cyst which was cancerous and my father didn't want to show up and see my procedure. I always thought his flight was cancelled but it was because he rather have sex with his wife since him and her were alone that week and my half brother was in camp. I have no respect for my father now. I was accepted to a school that was prestigious and he didn't want to pay for my tuition there bc the city wasn't nice enough so he can eat out and go to clubs like NYC or Philly. Every time my dad calls me it's only for 10min to waste time. He never wanted a child all he wanted was sex

[2021-04-13 06:20:04] (806892800301727775) P🌱#3042: Who’s they? Have you spoken to a doctor about how you feel recently? Not everyone has the mental capacity to deal with negative opinions so they may come across worse to them than you mean. Doesn’t mean you can’t talk to anyone about it
[2021-04-13 06:20:43] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I talk to a therapist once every two weeks

[2021-04-13 06:49:53] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: What do you gain out of it?
[2021-04-13 06:50:57] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: Just the knowledge and the happiness that we've helped someone through a shitty time
[2021-04-13 06:51:03] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: And that's enough for us
[2021-04-13 06:51:31] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: There's other people who need help way more urgently
[2021-04-13 06:52:09] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: And we can help them as well, some other time. But rn, u r the priority. U need help and we wanna give it to u
[2021-04-13 06:52:22] (806892800301727775) P🌱#3042: I’m happy if I can put my phone down knowing the person on the other end is feeling ok

[2021-04-13 06:53:05] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I should never be any priority in any situation
[2021-04-13 06:53:20] (806892800301727775) P🌱#3042: Why ?
[2021-04-13 06:53:22] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: Too bad. You're ours rn😁
[2021-04-13 06:56:51] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: Because I'm worthless
[2021-04-13 06:57:07] (806892800301727775) P🌱#3042: Well that’s straight wrong
[2021-04-13 06:57:07] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I don't have good qualities

[2021-04-13 06:57:25] (806892800301727775) P🌱#3042: Not that you can see
[2021-04-13 06:57:31] (806892800301727775) P🌱#3042: But they’re there
[2021-04-13 06:57:36] (806892800301727775) P🌱#3042: You just won’t allow yourself to see them
[2021-04-13 06:57:37] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: No one is worthless and everyone has amazing qualities. Unfortunately, when we feel bad we forget they exist
[2021-04-13 06:58:06] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: Even at the best of days I can't find any good qualities
[2021-04-13 06:58:37] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: How long have u been feeling bad fren
[2021-04-13 06:58:47] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I don't know
[2021-04-13 06:59:09] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: Probably over two years at the very least
[2021-04-13 06:59:40] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: Exactly. When u feel bad for that long, we forget what's good about us
[2021-04-13 07:00:05] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: It just gets worse though, so that has to mean something
[2021-04-13 07:00:24] (806892800301727775) P🌱#3042: Means you’re not getting the help you need from your therapist : doctor : meds etc
[2021-04-13 07:00:26] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: It means u just need extra good people around u
[2021-04-13 07:00:33] (806892800301727775) P🌱#3042: And this
[2021-04-13 07:00:48] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I don't take medicine
[2021-04-13 07:01:03] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: My parents wouldn't allow it anyway
[2021-04-13 07:01:32] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: P was just using examples since we're not sure of the exact circumstance with the support you're getting
[2021-04-13 07:03:07] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I shouldn't get any support
[2021-04-13 07:03:16] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I'm not good enough
[2021-04-13 07:06:04] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: You are good enough to come here and talk to us. That counts, right? Everyone deserves the support they need
[2021-04-13 07:06:28] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: That is 100% wrong fren. U deserve help and I've good enough
[2021-04-13 07:07:29] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I didn't earn it yet
[2021-04-13 07:07:38] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: U don't have to earn help
[2021-04-13 07:12:18] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: I get the whole not feeling "worthy" on an emotional level, but *everyone* deserves support if they need it. That means you too, no matter how low you feel, you are always worthy of help <:smileybread:771757646512259142>
[2021-04-13 07:15:09] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: It feels wrong to deserve anything positive..
[2021-04-13 07:16:35] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: Ik it does and Ik it'll b hard, but we'll make it so u know u deserve good things all the time
[2021-04-13 07:16:42] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: Every single one of us
[2021-04-13 07:22:59] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: Thank you..
[2021-04-13 07:24:22] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Definitely can feel like that if mood is low enough. Try and focus on positive things that you know you can do well, and give yourself credit for it. Might seem silly, but little steps add up. At least that helped for me
[2021-04-13 07:25:06] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: But I can do absolutely nothing well
[2021-04-13 07:25:31] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: Even my walking was described as looking like I had a stick up my ass
[2021-04-13 07:26:13] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: That's not very nice of whomever said that
[2021-04-13 07:27:10] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: My stile of clothing was described as bad as well
[2021-04-13 07:27:26] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: My voice is said to be terrible
[2021-04-13 07:28:41] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Honestly that just sounds like someone trying to be mean  😢
[2021-04-13 07:30:01] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: I mean is there even a "bad" style of clothing?
[2021-04-13 07:30:09] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: Yes
[2021-04-13 07:30:42] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: My favorite shirt apperantly looks like a pijama shirt
[2021-04-13 07:31:40] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Nothing wrong with pjs
[2021-04-13 07:31:57] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: If you get laughed at for that it is
[2021-04-13 07:33:37] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Aww
[2021-04-13 07:33:44] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Not nice of them!
[2021-04-13 07:34:23] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: One person said because I'm tall that there's a lot of place for shit
[2021-04-13 07:34:39] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: So I can't even exist without doing something wrong
[2021-04-13 07:37:43] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Honestly, it sounds like a lot of really uncalled-for comments. I mean in almost any other situation, those comments would be considered really rude and not appropriate at all. Your feelings are valid, even if the people saying these things are not. I think anyone that had to endure that kind of treatment would feel bad too.
[2021-04-13 07:38:45] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: We can only deal with so much negativity
[2021-04-13 07:39:39] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Not sure if I worded that correctly
[2021-04-13 07:39:46] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I still don't have the right to feel this bad
[2021-04-13 07:40:02] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Why do you say that?
[2021-04-13 07:40:32] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: We don't get to choose our emotions
[2021-04-13 07:41:21] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: It makes me not function efficiently anymore
[2021-04-13 07:42:25] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Yeah bad feelings definitely can have that effect
[2021-04-13 07:43:48] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: Yes, so I shouldn't feel like that
[2021-04-13 07:44:57] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: But you don't get to choose how you feel directly, right? So how can anyone say you should or shouldn't feel one way or another?
[2021-04-13 07:46:06] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: Once I have a job, my chef
Or my teachers
[2021-04-13 07:48:12] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: That is unreasonable of them to expect you to simply "feel better". That's just not how people deal with emotions and they should know that
[2021-04-13 08:01:16] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: That doesn't matter if I work as expected
[2021-04-13 08:06:25] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Not sure I  understand...
[2021-04-13 08:09:48] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: The process of dealing with negative emotions isn't an instant one. We need a little time and an outlet to work with too
[2021-04-13 08:11:13] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I know...
But others will be angry if I don't get better quickly
[2021-04-13 08:20:32] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I'm sorry..
[2021-04-13 08:20:55] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I think I'll distract myself a bit..
[2021-04-13 08:21:00] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: Thank all of you..
[2021-04-13 08:56:25] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Their anger is unjustified and not helping you feel better about yourself. We wouldn't get angry with someone who was not recovering "fast enough" from, say, ||flu||, right? So why would it be any different for emotional/psych troubles? I might be wrong, but it seems like you could benefit from surrounding yourself with people who don't treat you poorly, and maybe even empathize with your situation.
[2021-04-13 08:59:28] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: It's ok, you don't need to be sorry! <:smileybread:771757646512259142>  It's understandable to feel unworthy of help sometimes, but that can come from low mood
[2021-04-13 09:08:19] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: Thank you..
[2021-04-13 09:09:21] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I wanted to go to stationary therapy when my therapist said I really should do it, because it seemed really nice there and everybody seemed so friendly
[2021-04-13 11:44:58] (540371757769424921) Betsy#9202: You ever go driving at dawn, turn up the volume on the radio, and let the rock music crash around you until you feel like you could challenge any sentient power in the universe?

[2021-04-14 17:05:40] (666125620236910614) Morrow#7748: So in my Business Law class we're learning about criminal law and stuff like that. Back in 2014 or so, I knew someone who was I guess a friend of mine. We would exchange small talk and the like, and we were in the same organization for a time. He seemed like a pretty cool guy and he wasn't bad at all. A few years later, he was was on the news for arson and murdering 4 of his family members. When I saw that, I was already have a really bad day. One of my cousins had died from an opiod overdose and we had just gotten back from the funeral when I saw him on the news. Since we're learning about criminal law now, all I can think of is what he did and that I knew him. It kinda makes me sick to my stomach thinking about that. Like, my stomach gets in knots....I just hope that we can move past this criminal unit cause I don't like thinking about what he did or that I knew him. I never thought that in a million years that I would know a criminal

[2021-04-14 18:19:31] (279266238595858432) anzu68 (team parzu)#2459: <@!673611542419472438> no I mean she wanted me to block the online sister but my alter couldn't. And just before the breakup she said that she couldn't accept my alter as a part of the relationship since he was unable to block that sister...so that's why we broke up. But no you can't block alters forever. I thought the alter was gone, but he wasn't
[2021-04-14 18:20:28] (673611542419472438) JamJar#7479: Oh, thanks for educating me!
[2021-04-14 18:21:02] (673611542419472438) JamJar#7479: But why wantet your gf from you to block your online sis
[2021-04-14 18:24:06] (279266238595858432) anzu68 (team parzu)#2459: <@!673611542419472438> I was very close to that sister and my gf didn't like that. So one night I was delusional (I suffer from PTSD induced psychosis) and claimed my online sister was abusive so my gf confronted that sister and then spent hours trying to convince me to block that sister and that the sister was abusive...so I did. But then a few days later my alter unblocked them and I spoke to my sister and we realized it was all a giant misunderstanding. But my gf got very angry that the sister was unblocked, and I get it..she genuinely thought my sister was toxic, but I still couldn't cut off people who are like family to me. So that's why we had this huge fight and broke up
[2021-04-14 18:27:58] (673611542419472438) JamJar#7479: Oo, now I understand. Well- I don't know if you're going to try to get you gf back, that is your decision. I'm not you, but I would let it slide and heal with time.

[2021-04-15 19:53:14] (709011562941382686) Couchbean#0909: Well tbh I haven't processed it very well tbh, kinda just pushed it down bc like you I have that fear that she will do it and honestly im kinda fucked without her. I dont want to face that so I have ignored it. So please do not do wat I did, talking to people about it is good. I also know that its a lot to take in at first and terrifying af. And I really really wish i could tell you how to fix it but if im being honest I have no idea myself. I wish i knew wat to do so I could tell you but i don't. I live with the fear that she could be gone when I wake up every single day, it hurts and i really wish i could say it gets easier over time. But it doesn't or at least for me, you just learn to push it down further so it doesn't effect you until you eventually become numb to it. All I can really say is make sure your there for your mum and that she knows that you care. Spend time with her and help her, im wishing you the best friend bc honestly thats all I can say. And for my mum well, she's still unstable but can't afford a therapist unfortunately so thats a problem. I dont know wat to do and i wish i could give you better advice than this but I simply can't bc i dont know wat to do either
[2021-04-15 19:55:07] (709011562941382686) Couchbean#0909: This might not be wat you wanted to hear but I cant lie saying its all gonna be fine bc I dont know myself. And tbh thats the worst part of it, the uncertainty surrounding it
[2021-04-15 19:59:16] (641906654333370399) immarealcat#4410: Thank you, i wanted to hear a perspective of someone like you, how are you doing? Looking at you doing fine(by fine i mean going on with your life despite the harsh situation) i might be able to do it one day as well. But the thing is when i lose her I will lose everything, my dream of going to uni and just study what I always wanted to, so i don't know how will I "go on" with my life. I don't have a stable family either, my dad is very, very ||abusive, physically and emotionally|| and i don't know if he will support me when she's gone one day. Everything will end for me, and I just hope that day doesn't come any sooner. I wouldn't be as disappointed if she passes naturally than her ||taking her own life||, it means the end of my life too
[2021-04-15 20:14:54] (709011562941382686) Couchbean#0909: I know its hard to just carry on with your life after you've heard that from your mum. Its scary bc there's so many "what ifs and buts". All I can say is that we are all here for you and you can always talk to us. You can get through this, we can get through this together. I will say this dont try to dwell on the future bc it doesn't help. Which I know is hard bc theres so many thoughts going around your head but it doesn't help thinking about all the "whats ifs" all the time. I wish i could say more than we're all here for you but i can't. _massive huggos_ <3

[2021-04-16 05:31:49] (724264276990100027) streuselschnecken#4198: Hello everyone I don’t really know where to insert what I want to say so I am just going to guess it goes here (maybe?) but there’s been a looming question and curiosity in my mind that hasn’t gone away and I need to ask it. Usually when depression is exhibited it is portrayed through a type of lurking sadness/lack of motivation (think of the stereotypes depicted on social media, ads, etc) but my question is if it’s like this for anyone else; For the past 3+ years I would constantly have breakdowns, cry almost every night, attempted to off myself multiple times by trying to overdose on MDMA and Alcohol, but that all changed a few months ago- now it feels like I’m plagued with an emptiness not describable in words- just an empty husk, ghoulish even. I’m not sad anymore just empty and that’s about it. The only reason I get through my day is to just survive I guess you can say. Tired from the empty feeling I relapsed a week ago to get at least some semblance of feeling but I didn’t feel anything- which is the complete opposite to when I used to religiously do so. Back then I had these violent urges to off myself but now when those get in my head I don’t even have the energy to pursue those actions. I’m just curious to see if it’s the same for anyone else where it’s just this hollow feeling rather than sadness- anything would be nice to hear back

[2021-04-16 15:24:12] (409554778306248704) haloc#7839: ill try but i havent gone to a doctor in a while so idk who it is since we moved to a different area so i would have to ask my parents about it anyway lol
[2021-04-16 15:24:38] (409554778306248704) haloc#7839: but im gonna look up some info for my school first

[2021-04-16 15:26:46] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: Definitley try, schools usally have someone working with them to diagnose things like adhd and one thing that you should rember is the school person is not always that accurate and it is ok to ask for a second opinion!
[2021-04-16 15:29:07] (409554778306248704) haloc#7839: i will, i meant to ask my parents about a psychiatrist bc they know i have previous issues with anxiety but ive been doing ok so i havent gotten around to it yet

[2021-04-16 15:31:20] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: Its worth asking becuase sometimes they try not to advertise that so that the person who runs the diagnoses thingy doesn't get to overrun
[2021-04-16 15:32:18] (409554778306248704) haloc#7839: yeah i looked a little further and theres resources for a bunch of mental health issues but nothing really for neurodivergence so i might just have to ask a doctor
[2021-04-16 15:33:18] (409554778306248704) haloc#7839: but i know you can also get accommodations if you have adhd so its not like they dont acknowledge it or something
[2021-04-16 15:34:43] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: So, if you feel that you would be confortable talking to the school the school will try to help becuase if the school says something it might seem more real
[2021-04-16 15:35:05] (409554778306248704) haloc#7839: thats true
[2021-04-16 15:36:17] (409554778306248704) haloc#7839: im just not sure if theyre involved with this kind of thing bc theres counselling but that seems to be the extent of it
[2021-04-16 15:36:29] (409554778306248704) haloc#7839: but ill try asking about it

[2021-04-17 03:08:27] (814215847173685291) Chaotic Hellbender#1263: There is also alot of cheep, quality, virtual therapy right now if you are interested in trying that. Most colleges also have designated psychologists for students so that is another option.
[2021-04-17 03:08:38] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: oh yeah that's also an option
[2021-04-17 03:08:50] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: idk where you go to college but they should offer counselor sessions
[2021-04-17 03:09:00] (807127664171286567) lilsuzivert#7685: i have healthfirst its like the free medicaid insurance they gave out bc of covid or smthing idk im on my dad's plan
[2021-04-17 03:09:46] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We would not recommend those things if a person needs specialist help, such as trauma therapy.
[2021-04-17 03:09:48] (807127664171286567) lilsuzivert#7685: i go to a state school in new york, they have counselor sessions only if u pay the health service fee. i don't bc i requested a waiver since i live in ny and have healthcare covereage within 75 miles off campus
[2021-04-17 03:10:12] (807127664171286567) lilsuzivert#7685: but once again goes back to me finding something in-network
[2021-04-17 03:10:21] (807127664171286567) lilsuzivert#7685: and since im on my dad's plan my parent swill find out
[2021-04-17 03:10:44] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i mean, you are an adult and can make your own medical decisions
[2021-04-17 03:11:24] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: There are a lot of reasons to go to a therapist. If you're paying the co-pay then it should be easy enough to defend to them.
[2021-04-17 03:11:49] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: The ||pandeminc|| has been hard for people. You could deflect withthat.
[2021-04-17 03:12:07] (807127664171286567) lilsuzivert#7685: yea but like my family doesnt beleive in like mental health issues and stuff, like to them its "oh ur sad, be happy"
[2021-04-17 03:12:18] (807127664171286567) lilsuzivert#7685: so thats why i dont want them to know im tryna see a therapist
[2021-04-17 03:12:23] (807127664171286567) lilsuzivert#7685: also they'd think im crazy
[2021-04-17 03:12:55] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: mine are the same way but i just told them that i wanted to see a psychiatrist and that they had to respect that because i was old enough to make my own medical decisions
[2021-04-17 03:13:06] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Better that they think you're crazy at the moment, than you actually descend into madness due to lack of treatment. Our parents don't believe in mental health.
[2021-04-17 03:15:40] (807127664171286567) lilsuzivert#7685: nah like idk if u will get it but my dad and mom are refugees. my dad fleed from tibet, crossed the himalayas when he was still a kid and smuggled into India. My mom had her village destroyed by the Myanmar military and she had to flee to India as well. Like its not that simple to just explain "oh im more than just sad and i need medical help". Like they've been telling me since i was a kid i have no right to ever be sad bc i live in the US in a nice house and yk have good education and stuff
[2021-04-17 03:15:55] (807127664171286567) lilsuzivert#7685: its just not that simple to explain
[2021-04-17 03:16:04] (807127664171286567) lilsuzivert#7685: and i've tried before they don't understand
[2021-04-17 03:16:32] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: trust me i know what you mean. my parents always tell me that they got through their ||trauma|| without therapy so i should suck it up and learn how to deal with it.
[2021-04-17 03:16:42] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: but at the end of the day, you get to decide your life. not them.
[2021-04-17 03:17:46] (428653342999183370) keykey#0420: i believe planned parenthood might do short term counseling and maybe they can help find a longer term thing? it depends on where you live and if ur local pp has it
[2021-04-17 03:17:53] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: That sounds really hard, lilsuzivert. Our partner is a refugee. It can be really hard for people to see that the issues of people born here are not those of people born there, but that doesn't make them any less valid. We fight for our own lives, and our own freedoms. We can't just be happy because someone says that others have it worse.
[2021-04-17 04:16:48] (340385683409600512) c’est_la_vie.#1813: im really really overthinking. I do this a lot with people i really care about. if they dont answer their phone i immediately go into a panic mode kind of state. I'm not sure what to do but its really getting to me and i kinda just wanna be able to think like a basic human and not like overthink you know? Idk why im so messy..

[2021-04-17 04:20:16] (340385683409600512) c’est_la_vie.#1813: it weighs on people around me too and i genuinely feel guilty when they say they need space. like panic spam and all that. and then i regret it when im calm its a whole lotta mess.. idk
[2021-04-17 04:21:01] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: Yeah, I'm that way with very few people and it can affect your relationships with people.
[2021-04-17 04:21:02] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i actually don't think i'm up for support at the moment cause of how tired i am but we can talk tomorrow if you'd like

[2021-04-17 04:23:07] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: Haha, yeah. It's not easy, at all. but it's good that you're feeling a lil better!
[2021-04-17 04:23:11] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah i just wanna make sure that i'm mentally in the right place to give you the best support i can, ya know?
[2021-04-17 04:23:46] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: It's ok, I can try to do it with another person... I got you....
[2021-04-17 04:24:07] (340385683409600512) c’est_la_vie.#1813: if you ever need anything i get it! so even tho you might not know me well ill listen. 
that goes for everyone.
[2021-04-17 04:24:13] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: <@!427903354723631114> We cant talk in one of the public channels if you want.

[2021-04-19 21:44:54] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: Tyler Durden from the movie Fight Club.... The main characters alter ego that he talks to and he takes over when he thinks he falls asleep. Ed Norton is main character and Tyler Durden is like his raging anarchist 'id' that starts a Fight Club and builds it into a cult called project mayhem... And he thinks the whole time that Tyler was just his badass friend he met... But in fact he was Durden all along and has to thwart his own crazy plot to blow up the credit card skyscrapers and erase everyone's debt to zero. 

Brad Pitt is his confident brash gives no fucks self, and he idolizes him until he takes it too far and realizes Durden is dangerous and pure impulse and forcing him to break out of his mundane existence with what is ultimately a fucked up philosophy. 

Moral of the story: get some sleep and balance the different parts of yourself. But it would be cool to have a Brad Pitt alter ego. Pitt in his prime, yoked and has the guts to just live purely in the moment wherever it takes them/him being one person.
[2021-04-19 21:45:22] (600538913601486848) Ridiculum#7299: The funny thing is you barely realizing that movie that Tyler Durden, the imaginary friend alter ego has a name where as the main character Ed Norton does not.

To any of you who decided to reach out today, I am so proud of you for reaching out. It takes a lot of strength to admit that you need help sometimes. And I am very proud of you. 
I hope you understand that what you did is a very big achievement and you definitely deserve to understand that. Even in your darkest moment when you reach out I want you to remember that that is taking care of yourself.

The best thing to do after a break up is to take a break from romantic relationships in general and kind of take a breath and figure out where you are with yourself, just make sure your taking care of yourself.
[2021-04-21 04:35:25] (722510980785111092) Trish#1000: Also if your tired it’s best to sleep, hopefully you feel better and perhaps have more clarity in the morning.

[2021-04-23 08:22:19] (834138486105571349) 𝖇𝖆𝖐𝖆#4518: TW: sleep

||i dont get enough sleep. and if i do, i sleep the whole day. i love sleeping but i just stay up late and go to bed around 5AM. the highest amount of sleep i have gotten is 10h. other than that i sleep for like 3 hours. and the fact i have to get up at 8:30 tmr, is really not it.||
[2021-04-23 11:19:39] (375665878743908353) MetalWarBeast#5052: I feel trapped in my own head. The only way I have managed to escape from my constant anxiety is by drinking heavily, and I am almost certain I have contributed to my early death by doing so. 4-5 months of fairly heavy drinking at night feels like something that will shorten your lifespan a bit. I wish I hadn’t even started, but then again, that was the first time I got to experience being anxiety-free. Even now, I feel it creeping back in. I will take melatonin soon to force myself to fall back asleep, but why the hell does it have to be this way. What can’t my mind just calm the f*** down on its own, why do I need to force it with chemicals.  This is exhausting. Living is exhausting. I don’t know what to do anymore. It does feel like my life was meant to end earlier, because it has become a very pointless spiral into nothingness. My dreams of having a great career were just that—dreams. I exist to make as much money I can until retirement, and then what? I’m not enjoying life right now, I can’t imagine deriving much enjoyment from it at 70.
[2021-04-23 11:21:27] (375665878743908353) MetalWarBeast#5052: I have an associate’s degree, but it feels utterly pointless to continue toiling away for the bachelor’s at this point. I’ve been in and out of college for years, and I want to give up. None of it has brought me closer to happiness.
[2021-04-23 11:22:42] (375665878743908353) MetalWarBeast#5052: The only thing I really have going for me is an excellent credit score, and some savings. I can move to a lot of different places in the U.S. if I wanted to, but I don’t know how long I’d be able to maintain that momentum just working minimum wage
[2021-04-23 11:23:59] (375665878743908353) MetalWarBeast#5052: The alcohol is wearing off, and I can feel myself becoming completely lucid, which means the anxiety is becoming overwhelming again. It want it to stop so bad
[2021-04-23 11:26:10] (375665878743908353) MetalWarBeast#5052: I am trapped in my head, and that is the best way to put it. My mind has become a very painful prison
[2021-04-23 11:27:41] (375665878743908353) MetalWarBeast#5052: It’s like the “it hurt itself in confusion!” thing from Pokémon. That’s how my mind feels, just constantly hurting itself with anxiety and negative thoughts

[2021-04-23 15:57:14] (269776755328286720) Mange25#0600: I'm tired of life, no one caring, getting rejected by every girl I talk to, getting led on, keeping a fake smile,  feeling numb, holding tears back. I feel like no one likes me and I will be lonely forever. I feel like my life isn't worth living anymore, but the only reason I'm still here is because of my dad and the few people that care and I don't want them feeling sad about my death. I still want to see my future and what I have to come, but... I don't know if... I'm strong enough to keep pushing through life and all the bullshit I have to go through everything just sucks and I really hope that things do get better just like people say because I don't know how much longer I can do this for. I always say I'm alright, but I'm really not I don't want people worrying about me. I'm fighting to push through life every day and I try to stay positive and try to keep everyone else happy so they don't have to go through what I am because it really does suck.

[2021-04-23 21:57:12] (718269462582919270) MrBombastic#6702: I am working on opening a psychiatry practice
[2021-04-23 21:57:27] (718269462582919270) MrBombastic#6702: how much do you guys spend on initial psych eval/repeat visits?

[2021-04-23 21:57:56] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: google should give you the average rather than asking personal info
[2021-04-23 21:58:15] (718269462582919270) MrBombastic#6702: google numbers are skewed
[2021-04-23 21:58:36] (718269462582919270) MrBombastic#6702: also would you be opposed to going to a practice primarily run by a PMHNP?
[2021-04-23 21:59:28] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: this isnt really the best place to ask, you should ask your mental health governing body and board of director
[2021-04-23 21:59:47] (718269462582919270) MrBombastic#6702: mental health governing body would just say its legal to run one
[2021-04-23 22:00:04] (718269462582919270) MrBombastic#6702: they wouldn't say whether someone is opposed in going to a practice run by an NP
[2021-04-23 22:00:06] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Should have price guidelines and everything as well.

[2021-04-23 22:00:50] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: then you can do focus groups, not ask strangers on discord, people who sign up to share that info.

[2021-04-24 15:08:32] (827930081040662539) Ashy#8762: Well if they are || beating you || you should call child support or even the police if it's that serious.
[2021-04-24 15:08:56] (448110450094243840) kitkate#1477: sorry for a lil light vent but, basically during lockdown me and my friend decided to get matching tattoos together (not exactly matching just a similar theme) and as her birthday present i offered to pay for her tattoo too
and now that tattoo shops are open i wanted to go asap but its already been a month and she's currently getting a different tattoo with her other friend... even though the ones we planned together i couldn't wait to get, and i mean it's free for her... idk if it's reasonable for me to be a bit upset about it, or if its just my anxiety
[2021-04-24 15:08:57] (648496978761744394) Zorphite#5599: but ever since my younger sister was born they've stopped ||beating me for no reason||  but rather they yell at me all the time and occasionally use a lot of ||abusive language|| when shes its around.

Being compared is awful, especially based on something like grades or school - it is just unfair. People are different and learn differently, future does not depend on grades nor school
[2021-04-26 19:21:15] (449600974365917195) Duck#1212: The grades don't even reflect the level of knowledge well, let alone the ambitions and thoughts of future

[2021-04-28 17:45:25] (722510980785111092) Trish#8008: I don’t think so, he knows I’m forgetful. But I don’t think he knows about dissociation.
[2021-04-28 17:45:57] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: i think it might be good to say that you may have figured out why you maybe forget and bring in dissociation from there
[2021-04-28 17:46:15] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: and (if your comfy) bring in how thats a thing from ptsd

Secondly, maybe some of this stuff happened because of the way they *interpreted* your note, so maybe phrasing it differently now that you're older will help!
[2021-04-28 21:19:15] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: all it needed was a ||plaster||
[2021-04-28 21:19:52] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Oh yeah haha that's the same thing XD We call ||plasters|| ||band-aids|| in the US!

[2021-04-28 21:37:50] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Well, I'm going to go now, but I think if you wrote a note or said something that made whatever problem you have seem like a concern or topic of interest, it wouldn't seem like a problem to others, and might not cause problems for you.

I personally have an experience where a behavior I have is unappealing to ||law enforcement|| (||skin-picking - they believed it to be self-harm||) and I had to phrase my issue different to get help, so I just said that I started to get really nervous about a lot of things I wasn't nervous about before, and then I was able to get help and decide from there if I wanted to talk about it.
[2021-04-28 21:38:48] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: ok
[2021-04-28 21:39:39] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Good luck, and I really hope you are able to get help or at least a professional opinion!

But I've come to realize that you don't decide how you respond to the outside world, your brain decides. Just like how you can't really control your heart rate when you run, even if there is no danger. So hopefully you can feel better about that, because I'm still learning, too.

[2021-04-29 17:52:45] (540025213371416606) ResentedFamilyMember#9862: ||i just cant do this antmoer|| its becoming too much and i just applied for a new job and dont want to screw that up
[2021-04-29 17:54:14] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Life can suck ass sometimes, for sure. Drinking doesn't make it better though. It turns one problem into two, and then they just keep multiplying. Stopping drinking for 3 years is a huge accomplishment. Something we have never been able to do, even. You already did it once, and no doubt you had a good reason. You've just got to find your way down that path again.
[2021-04-29 17:56:13] (540025213371416606) ResentedFamilyMember#9862: i dont know if i can find that path agian

[2021-04-29 18:00:17] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Really sorry that happened to you, Member. Do you have a therapist or counselor to talk about these things with?

[2021-04-29 18:00:59] (540025213371416606) ResentedFamilyMember#9862: i havnt seen her in a month cuz my mom has been forgetgting to reschesule me
[2021-04-29 18:01:24] (540025213371416606) ResentedFamilyMember#9862: we have mostly been focusing on my past trauma and nto the drinking tho
[2021-04-29 18:02:03] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Yeah, that's understandable. The two things are likely linked to some degree, so it's good that you've been making progress towards that. Does your therapist know about your history with drinking?
[2021-04-29 18:02:13] (540025213371416606) ResentedFamilyMember#9862: yes she does
[2021-04-29 18:02:46] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: It sounds like you've been able to establish a trusting relationship with them. Would you say that's true?
[2021-04-29 18:02:54] (540025213371416606) ResentedFamilyMember#9862: yea
[2021-04-29 18:03:14] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: That's really great to hear. Sometimes it can be hard to connect with a therapist and that can create barriers to treatment.
[2021-04-29 18:03:54] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: You family knows about the drinking thing as well then?
[2021-04-29 18:04:47] (540025213371416606) ResentedFamilyMember#9862: yes
[2021-04-29 18:06:22] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: You said you didn't want to disappoint them, but do you think it could be helpful for you to talk to them about your relapse?
[2021-04-29 18:07:36] (540025213371416606) ResentedFamilyMember#9862: i dont think it would help. they woudl be really mad at me and i would get into another fight with my dad. ||he can be quite abusive. last time we got into a fight he choked me and threatened to punch me||
[2021-04-29 18:08:30] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Wow, that is really not ok. We're sad to hear that you have to deal with that.
[2021-04-29 18:09:09] (540025213371416606) ResentedFamilyMember#9862: ive lived with it for 7 years i just want to get out but my dad manipulated me into not leaving home til im 19 and legally an adult in my state

[2021-04-29 18:10:52] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: It's a really difficult point in your life. Right before adulthood, given many expectations with very few freedoms. It can be very confusing. Have you tried talking to your therapist about options for you to leave early if you need to?
[2021-04-29 18:18:50] (540025213371416606) ResentedFamilyMember#9862: yea

Hopefully you can convince your mom to make another appointment soon. If not, you could try emailing your therapist's office and prompting them to call her.
