[2021-04-09 17:14:33] (698719918836809738) consistantlyconfused#6794: I have these vision boards that my ||therapist|| suggested I make and they've been really helpful, but the adhesive I used to hang them up is wearing. I had four little boards and two of them fell a few days ago. One of them just fell off the wall and I'm not sure why, but for some reason it really hurts my mental state when they fall. I only have one left on my wall and I haven't been able to bring myself to hang them back up. Sorry if this is in the wrong channel, it's just really frustrating how quickly my mood changed.

[2021-04-11 03:52:28] (796641918460231732) ElonMuskQuant#2362: Today, I learned after a screaming suicide attempt again from my mom that my dad never wanted to see me or associate him with me. My parents got divorced after an emotionally abusive marriage and my father forbids me to see my grandparents and only saw me when he was getting in trouble with his new wife. He signed custody away from me and never wanted to see me and only did after his parents screamed at him. I also learned when I needed surgery when I was 12 bc I may had a cyst which was cancerous and my father didn't want to show up and see my procedure. I always thought his flight was cancelled but it was because he rather have sex with his wife since him and her were alone that week and my half brother was in camp. I have no respect for my father now. I was accepted to a school that was prestigious and he didn't want to pay for my tuition there bc the city wasn't nice enough so he can eat out and go to clubs like NYC or Philly. Every time my dad calls me it's only for 10min to waste time. He never wanted a child all he wanted was sex

[2021-04-13 06:20:04] (806892800301727775) P🌱#3042: Who’s they? Have you spoken to a doctor about how you feel recently? Not everyone has the mental capacity to deal with negative opinions so they may come across worse to them than you mean. Doesn’t mean you can’t talk to anyone about it
[2021-04-13 06:20:43] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I talk to a therapist once every two weeks

[2021-04-13 06:49:53] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: What do you gain out of it?
[2021-04-13 06:50:57] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: Just the knowledge and the happiness that we've helped someone through a shitty time
[2021-04-13 06:51:03] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: And that's enough for us
[2021-04-13 06:51:31] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: There's other people who need help way more urgently
[2021-04-13 06:52:09] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: And we can help them as well, some other time. But rn, u r the priority. U need help and we wanna give it to u
[2021-04-13 06:52:22] (806892800301727775) P🌱#3042: I’m happy if I can put my phone down knowing the person on the other end is feeling ok

[2021-04-13 06:53:05] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I should never be any priority in any situation
[2021-04-13 06:53:20] (806892800301727775) P🌱#3042: Why ?
[2021-04-13 06:53:22] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: Too bad. You're ours rn😁
[2021-04-13 06:56:51] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: Because I'm worthless
[2021-04-13 06:57:07] (806892800301727775) P🌱#3042: Well that’s straight wrong
[2021-04-13 06:57:07] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I don't have good qualities

[2021-04-13 06:57:25] (806892800301727775) P🌱#3042: Not that you can see
[2021-04-13 06:57:31] (806892800301727775) P🌱#3042: But they’re there
[2021-04-13 06:57:36] (806892800301727775) P🌱#3042: You just won’t allow yourself to see them
[2021-04-13 06:57:37] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: No one is worthless and everyone has amazing qualities. Unfortunately, when we feel bad we forget they exist
[2021-04-13 06:58:06] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: Even at the best of days I can't find any good qualities
[2021-04-13 06:58:37] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: How long have u been feeling bad fren
[2021-04-13 06:58:47] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I don't know
[2021-04-13 06:59:09] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: Probably over two years at the very least
[2021-04-13 06:59:40] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: Exactly. When u feel bad for that long, we forget what's good about us
[2021-04-13 07:00:05] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: It just gets worse though, so that has to mean something
[2021-04-13 07:00:24] (806892800301727775) P🌱#3042: Means you’re not getting the help you need from your therapist : doctor : meds etc
[2021-04-13 07:00:26] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: It means u just need extra good people around u
[2021-04-13 07:00:33] (806892800301727775) P🌱#3042: And this
[2021-04-13 07:00:48] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I don't take medicine
[2021-04-13 07:01:03] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: My parents wouldn't allow it anyway
[2021-04-13 07:01:32] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: P was just using examples since we're not sure of the exact circumstance with the support you're getting
[2021-04-13 07:03:07] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I shouldn't get any support
[2021-04-13 07:03:16] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I'm not good enough
[2021-04-13 07:06:04] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: You are good enough to come here and talk to us. That counts, right? Everyone deserves the support they need
[2021-04-13 07:06:28] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: That is 100% wrong fren. U deserve help and I've good enough
[2021-04-13 07:07:29] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I didn't earn it yet
[2021-04-13 07:07:38] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: U don't have to earn help
[2021-04-13 07:12:18] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: I get the whole not feeling "worthy" on an emotional level, but *everyone* deserves support if they need it. That means you too, no matter how low you feel, you are always worthy of help <:smileybread:771757646512259142>
[2021-04-13 07:15:09] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: It feels wrong to deserve anything positive..
[2021-04-13 07:16:35] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: Ik it does and Ik it'll b hard, but we'll make it so u know u deserve good things all the time
[2021-04-13 07:16:42] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: Every single one of us
[2021-04-13 07:22:59] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: Thank you..
[2021-04-13 07:24:22] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Definitely can feel like that if mood is low enough. Try and focus on positive things that you know you can do well, and give yourself credit for it. Might seem silly, but little steps add up. At least that helped for me
[2021-04-13 07:25:06] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: But I can do absolutely nothing well
[2021-04-13 07:25:31] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: Even my walking was described as looking like I had a stick up my ass
[2021-04-13 07:26:13] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: That's not very nice of whomever said that
[2021-04-13 07:27:10] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: My stile of clothing was described as bad as well
[2021-04-13 07:27:26] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: My voice is said to be terrible
[2021-04-13 07:28:41] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Honestly that just sounds like someone trying to be mean  😢
[2021-04-13 07:30:01] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: I mean is there even a "bad" style of clothing?
[2021-04-13 07:30:09] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: Yes
[2021-04-13 07:30:42] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: My favorite shirt apperantly looks like a pijama shirt
[2021-04-13 07:31:40] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Nothing wrong with pjs
[2021-04-13 07:31:57] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: If you get laughed at for that it is
[2021-04-13 07:33:37] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Aww
[2021-04-13 07:33:44] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Not nice of them!
[2021-04-13 07:34:23] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: One person said because I'm tall that there's a lot of place for shit
[2021-04-13 07:34:39] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: So I can't even exist without doing something wrong
[2021-04-13 07:37:43] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Honestly, it sounds like a lot of really uncalled-for comments. I mean in almost any other situation, those comments would be considered really rude and not appropriate at all. Your feelings are valid, even if the people saying these things are not. I think anyone that had to endure that kind of treatment would feel bad too.
[2021-04-13 07:38:45] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: We can only deal with so much negativity
[2021-04-13 07:39:39] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Not sure if I worded that correctly
[2021-04-13 07:39:46] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I still don't have the right to feel this bad
[2021-04-13 07:40:02] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Why do you say that?
[2021-04-13 07:40:32] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: We don't get to choose our emotions
[2021-04-13 07:41:21] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: It makes me not function efficiently anymore
[2021-04-13 07:42:25] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Yeah bad feelings definitely can have that effect
[2021-04-13 07:43:48] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: Yes, so I shouldn't feel like that
[2021-04-13 07:44:57] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: But you don't get to choose how you feel directly, right? So how can anyone say you should or shouldn't feel one way or another?
[2021-04-13 07:46:06] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: Once I have a job, my chef
Or my teachers
[2021-04-13 07:48:12] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: That is unreasonable of them to expect you to simply "feel better". That's just not how people deal with emotions and they should know that
[2021-04-13 08:01:16] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: That doesn't matter if I work as expected
[2021-04-13 08:06:25] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Not sure I  understand...
[2021-04-13 08:09:48] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: The process of dealing with negative emotions isn't an instant one. We need a little time and an outlet to work with too
[2021-04-13 08:11:13] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I know...
But others will be angry if I don't get better quickly
[2021-04-13 08:20:32] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I'm sorry..
[2021-04-13 08:20:55] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I think I'll distract myself a bit..
[2021-04-13 08:21:00] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: Thank all of you..
[2021-04-13 08:56:25] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Their anger is unjustified and not helping you feel better about yourself. We wouldn't get angry with someone who was not recovering "fast enough" from, say, ||flu||, right? So why would it be any different for emotional/psych troubles? I might be wrong, but it seems like you could benefit from surrounding yourself with people who don't treat you poorly, and maybe even empathize with your situation.
[2021-04-13 08:59:28] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: It's ok, you don't need to be sorry! <:smileybread:771757646512259142>  It's understandable to feel unworthy of help sometimes, but that can come from low mood
[2021-04-13 09:08:19] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: Thank you..
[2021-04-13 09:09:21] (468514325049638912) New Schwarz#7195: I wanted to go to stationary therapy when my therapist said I really should do it, because it seemed really nice there and everybody seemed so friendly
[2021-04-13 11:44:58] (540371757769424921) Betsy#9202: You ever go driving at dawn, turn up the volume on the radio, and let the rock music crash around you until you feel like you could challenge any sentient power in the universe?

[2021-04-14 17:05:40] (666125620236910614) Morrow#7748: So in my Business Law class we're learning about criminal law and stuff like that. Back in 2014 or so, I knew someone who was I guess a friend of mine. We would exchange small talk and the like, and we were in the same organization for a time. He seemed like a pretty cool guy and he wasn't bad at all. A few years later, he was was on the news for arson and murdering 4 of his family members. When I saw that, I was already have a really bad day. One of my cousins had died from an opiod overdose and we had just gotten back from the funeral when I saw him on the news. Since we're learning about criminal law now, all I can think of is what he did and that I knew him. It kinda makes me sick to my stomach thinking about that. Like, my stomach gets in knots....I just hope that we can move past this criminal unit cause I don't like thinking about what he did or that I knew him. I never thought that in a million years that I would know a criminal

[2021-04-14 18:19:31] (279266238595858432) anzu68 (team parzu)#2459: <@!673611542419472438> no I mean she wanted me to block the online sister but my alter couldn't. And just before the breakup she said that she couldn't accept my alter as a part of the relationship since he was unable to block that sister...so that's why we broke up. But no you can't block alters forever. I thought the alter was gone, but he wasn't

[2021-04-14 18:21:02] (673611542419472438) JamJar#7479: But why wantet your gf from you to block your online sis
[2021-04-14 18:24:06] (279266238595858432) anzu68 (team parzu)#2459: <@!673611542419472438> I was very close to that sister and my gf didn't like that. So one night I was delusional (I suffer from PTSD induced psychosis) and claimed my online sister was abusive so my gf confronted that sister and then spent hours trying to convince me to block that sister and that the sister was abusive...so I did. But then a few days later my alter unblocked them and I spoke to my sister and we realized it was all a giant misunderstanding. But my gf got very angry that the sister was unblocked, and I get it..she genuinely thought my sister was toxic, but I still couldn't cut off people who are like family to me. So that's why we had this huge fight and broke up
[2021-04-14 18:27:58] (673611542419472438) JamJar#7479: Oo, now I understand. Well- I don't know if you're going to try to get you gf back, that is your decision. I'm not you, but I would let it slide and heal with time.
[2021-04-14 18:28:52] (279266238595858432) anzu68 (team parzu)#2459: <@!673611542419472438> I will try to stay friends with my gf for sure. I don't hate my gf...but I won't go back to them. Neither of us was ready for the relationship
[2021-04-14 18:30:12] (673611542419472438) JamJar#7479: I think that is a good decision.
