[2021-04-10 23:55:17] (829482636589269003) .moon.#6388: I am struggling severely with my anxiety, and yes, I know, when a teenager says that, it's viewed as normal and common, but please trust me when I tell you that this is worse than your typical anxiety.
[2021-04-10 23:56:35] (829482636589269003) .moon.#6388: For example, it gets at it's worst around school: through out all my lessons, my muscles will stay tense and mu stomach ache will last hours upon hours, and I can never stop the shaking. I struggle to eat my lunch in school because I constantly feel ill when I am in school.
[2021-04-10 23:59:59] (829482636589269003) .moon.#6388: And I will have about 5 anxiety attacks everyday school day. I always get one before school that turns into a panic attack, then I always get another anxiety in period 1 when I have just got to school because I feel so scared.  (You get the jist) And I always get one after, because I relive to whole day in my head trying to find the areas when people will have judged me.
[2021-04-11 00:01:22] (829482636589269003) .moon.#6388: And that's just a snowflake on the top of the tip of the anxiety iceberg.
[2021-04-11 00:02:31] (829482636589269003) .moon.#6388: It also gets highly bad in public, I have twice had a sobbing panic attack outside of shops because it terrify s me to the gut.
[2021-04-11 00:02:56] (829482636589269003) .moon.#6388: Wow sorry, I just threw a lot at you
[2021-04-11 00:04:34] (95164972807487488) squ√≠rrel#2475: Hi <@!829482636589269003> , it's okay I understand what you are describing perfectly, having gone through some of it myself when I was younger, school doesn't exactly feel like the friendliest place sometimes and based on what you're describing can be quite a lot to deal with
[2021-04-11 00:04:47] (829482636589269003) .moon.#6388: Yea
[2021-04-11 00:05:02] (829482636589269003) .moon.#6388: especially with lockdowns and going in and out
[2021-04-11 00:05:35] (95164972807487488) squ√≠rrel#2475: indeed, has lockdown helped with anxiety? I assume a lot of school was done remotely/from home during that time?
[2021-04-11 00:07:22] (829482636589269003) .moon.#6388: When I was actually in the lockdown and doing work at home I was loving life, I got all my favorite parts of school like the actual work, and I didn't get the social element that I hate.But it did mean that as we got out of lockdown, the anxiety hit me like a ton of bricks.
[2021-04-11 00:08:48] (95164972807487488) squ√≠rrel#2475: I can relate to that, it's probably similar to the feeling you get on Sundays as Monday draws closer, that was more or less the worst period of the week for me. Is there anything in particular that's worrying you at the moment, or just the whole thing?
[2021-04-11 00:09:49] (829482636589269003) .moon.#6388: I always try to put my finger on what exactly worries me about school, because it would be easier to sort out, but I never am able to, it's basically the whole idea of school in general
[2021-04-11 00:10:23] (95164972807487488) squ√≠rrel#2475: Yeah, I get that. Are you currently in contact with a doctor about this?
[2021-04-11 00:10:29] (829482636589269003) .moon.#6388: No
[2021-04-11 00:12:08] (95164972807487488) squ√≠rrel#2475: Okay, anxiety can be pretty difficult to deal with, naturally the anxiety is probably gonna make going to the doctor a lot more difficult so this is something you should look towards if you can. Short term I can recommend trying to do breathing exercises when you feel the anxiety increasing. Are you aware of how to control your breathing in these situations?
[2021-04-11 00:12:53] (829482636589269003) .moon.#6388: I know about breathing exercises for anxiety but I have never knew how to do them
[2021-04-11 00:16:22] (95164972807487488) squ√≠rrel#2475: Cool, no worries, I can describe a fairly simple exercise for you to try. It sounds very basic and silly in a way but give it a go; Try to get in a comfortable position (granted this can be hard whilst in school) then close your eyes and slowly take a deep breath in through the nose. Hold the breath for a short second and then exhale through the mouth and imagine the anxiety leaving your body through your extremities or breath. If closing your eyes isn't possible (cause you're out in public for example) then you can skip that step and still try doing the breathing. Repeat this a few times and you should feel your heart rate and tightness start to ease a little
[2021-04-11 00:17:38] (95164972807487488) squ√≠rrel#2475: there is a gif to help guide you to  start of with, you can save this and use this if you need some help to start off wit

[2021-04-11 00:17:56] (829482636589269003) .moon.#6388: The funny thing is, I was actually trembling a few minutes ago but I tried the breathing thing for a second and its mainly stopped. That will be good to stop my panic and shaking in school
[2021-04-11 00:18:14] (829482636589269003) .moon.#6388: thankyou for this
[2021-04-11 00:19:07] (95164972807487488) squ√≠rrel#2475: Breathing exercises help to alleviate anxiety symptoms in the short term if you can feel them coming on
[2021-04-11 00:19:46] (95164972807487488) squ√≠rrel#2475: The long term solution would be to contact your doctor when you feel ready to and explain, there are medications to try and control the symptoms of anxiety and often therapy will be recommended as well
[2021-04-11 00:20:11] (829482636589269003) .moon.#6388: I had heard of them before but part of me thought that it "wouldn't be enough" to help calm myself, however it worked su
prisingly well
[2021-04-11 00:20:50] (95164972807487488) squ√≠rrel#2475: Yes, I had exactly the same thought and they help me sometimes as well, it surprises me every now and then as well üòÑ
[2021-04-11 00:21:10] (829482636589269003) .moon.#6388: My sister is actually getting therapy for her anxiety and my mum says she wants to talk to me about it too, that would be a good oppertunity  to get help
[2021-04-11 00:21:41] (95164972807487488) squ√≠rrel#2475: yes, absolutely. That sounds like a good plan to aim for
[2021-04-11 00:22:10] (829482636589269003) .moon.#6388: This has been really helpful.
[2021-04-11 00:22:35] (95164972807487488) squ√≠rrel#2475: I'm happy to have helped you a little here
[2021-04-11 00:23:03] (829482636589269003) .moon.#6388: Thank you so much, I know my atrocious spelling and overload of problem can be a lot to handle.
[2021-04-11 00:24:04] (95164972807487488) squ√≠rrel#2475: no no, we're here to help and your spelling has been fine. I always want to say "don't worry" but I know that probably doesn't help much when you have anxiety üòõ
[2021-04-11 00:24:31] (829482636589269003) .moon.#6388: bahahha thanks once again
[2021-04-11 00:25:02] (95164972807487488) squ√≠rrel#2475: you are very welcome, I will close this ticket. Please feel free to create a new ticket if you feel the need for support again at a later time <:hugs:771753710526267403>
