[2021-04-16 02:59:19] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: tw: suicide, depression, dysphoria, transphobia
[2021-04-16 02:59:42] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: (btw you don't have to censor anything in this ticket since i don't have any triggers)
[2021-04-16 03:00:00] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: I’m a freak who thinks he’s a woman. I’m a delusional idiot who thinks just wanting to be a woman makes him one. I hate my body and I hate myself. I have no one to talk to. I just want to be killed by someone already. I wish a car just ran over me or someone would come to shoot me in the head.

I don’t deserve life. I want the pain to end. I can’t handle it anymore.

I’m a creep and a disgusting perverted loser. I’m fucking degenerate subhuman trash. I’m a mentally ill piece of shit that should just be murdered already. I wish my parents killed me. I wish I was euthanized. I wish I was dead.

I hate living. I hate the pain of existence. I hate my body. I hate my brain. I hate my thoughts. I hate my feelings. I hate everything.

I have no one to talk to. My parents will hate me. My sister will hate me. I have no friends. Every other person out there with my problems is mentally ill and can’t handle what I say. I will trigger them to kill themselves. I can’t afford a therapist. I don’t have insurance. I can’t do anything.
[2021-04-16 03:02:29] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i'm sorry that you're going through all of this. i can't imagine how painful it has to feel to not be comfortable in your own body. regardless you're valid. you're woman regardless of your body or of what others say. i take it that you're under 18 and live with my family currently?
[2021-04-16 03:05:01] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: I'm 26 and am reliant on my parents though I don't live with them
[2021-04-16 03:05:15] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: I have been repressing for years
[2021-04-16 03:05:25] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: I tried coming out online recently
[2021-04-16 03:05:30] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: But dysphoria is getting worse
[2021-04-16 03:05:35] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: I can't handle it anymore
[2021-04-16 03:05:37] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i understand. is there anyway that you can express your gender identity freely in your own house?
[2021-04-16 03:05:59] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: The only thing I can do is shave my body hair
[2021-04-16 03:06:12] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: all my finances are controlled by my parents
[2021-04-16 03:06:49] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: is there anyway that you can try and put some money aside and purchase a bra?
[2021-04-16 03:07:19] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: I am a student in med school. I have no income
[2021-04-16 03:07:45] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: I've tried wearing feminine clothing before and it just makes me feel like a man in a dress
[2021-04-16 03:07:53] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: like a disgusting piece of shit
[2021-04-16 03:08:00] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: who will always scare other people
[2021-04-16 03:08:11] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: who will always creep out women and young girls
[2021-04-16 03:08:15] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: I don't want to do that
[2021-04-16 03:10:18] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i understand how you feel. it's hard to feel like you could ever pass. but you're not disgusting. why would people be upset about someone wearing a dress? it doesn't really matter what they think. they're only people who will see you for a few brief seconds of their lives.
[2021-04-16 03:12:36] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i also don't know if this helps but there's a website that sends out free femme shapewear to trans people who can't get it for financial or safety reasons
[2021-04-16 03:12:42] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: https://pointofpride.org/trans-femme-shapewear/
[2021-04-16 03:12:56] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: Thank you for that
[2021-04-16 03:13:42] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: no problem. i understand how hard it is to deal with dysphoria so i'm glad to give any resources i can to help.
[2021-04-16 03:14:25] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: I literally don’t have any way to relieve it except shaving myself because that’s hidden through clothing
[2021-04-16 03:14:51] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: Then I don’t know any trans ppl irl to talk to
[2021-04-16 03:14:58] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: Can’t see a therapist
[2021-04-16 03:15:48] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: I’m too paralyzed by fear of what hrt will do to me to go to Planned Parenthood and get some
[2021-04-16 03:16:15] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: I feel like since stopping repressing everything is just getting worse
[2021-04-16 03:16:50] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: have you thought about going to planned parenthood and just talking to the doctors there about HRT?
[2021-04-16 03:17:12] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: you don't have to make any decisions. you can just ask any questions you have.
[2021-04-16 03:17:32] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: I am very masc too 
So I don’t know how to say someone like me is a woman
[2021-04-16 03:19:26] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: you don't have to worry about that because if you say you're a woman, the doctors will believe you. the people at planned parenthood don't judge based on appearance.
[2021-04-16 03:20:28] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: I’m too scared to even try
At least with this masc body some people think I’m good enough to be attractive 
I could fall in love and be a motherly father or something to my kids 
But if I transition no one will love me 
I will never be a mother I will never have kids I will always be an ugly disgusting simulacra of what a woman is
[2021-04-16 03:21:20] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: that's not true. 
you could also transition and be much happier cause you don't have to hide. 
and then one day marry someone who loves you for you and raise a family.
[2021-04-16 03:21:58] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: No one will love someone as mentally ill and ugly as me
[2021-04-16 03:22:23] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: Not even my parents love who I truly am
[2021-04-16 03:23:16] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: if your parents don't then they're just bad parents. they are not a representation of how lovable you are. no one is incapable of being loved.
[2021-04-16 03:24:10] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: there are people who don't see us the way we see ourselves.
[2021-04-16 03:25:35] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: How do I find them
[2021-04-16 03:26:06] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: I just want someone who can hold me and I can hold them back
[2021-04-16 03:26:23] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: I don’t even care about sex
[2021-04-16 03:27:07] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: it takes a lot of trial and error but those people are out there. the best way to start is by reaching out to new people.
[2021-04-16 03:29:06] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: I'm a pre-transition trans woman. who will accept me
[2021-04-16 03:29:15] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: I don't even know who to reach out to
[2021-04-16 03:29:37] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: I tried finding a trans support group
[2021-04-16 03:29:52] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: but they told me to leave and get real help because I was too depressing
[2021-04-16 03:30:01] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: but I can't get real help
[2021-04-16 03:30:04] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: surprisingly more people than you might think. my ex was very supportive of me when i came out and i looked very feminine.
[2021-04-16 03:30:32] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i don't think that was fair of them. it's important to have a community no matter how much you're going through. have you found any communities online?
[2021-04-16 03:31:57] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: All the communities I’ve found online are hugboxy, filled with children, or people don’t respond
[2021-04-16 03:35:06] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i understand. if you want, i would do some research and try and find some servers targeted towards 18+ trans individuals.
[2021-04-16 03:35:30] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: The ones I’ve found aren’t helpful
[2021-04-16 03:36:00] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: Do you know any other free services like the one you posted above?
[2021-04-16 03:36:21] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i can definitely do some research and see if i can find anything else
[2021-04-16 03:37:33] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: Thank you 
I think that’ll help most
[2021-04-16 03:37:44] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: I just wish I wasn’t trans
[2021-04-16 03:37:53] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: I wish I was normal
[2021-04-16 03:38:20] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: Didn’t have to deal with dysphoria
[2021-04-16 03:38:47] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i know but you also shouldn't beat yourself up for feeling the way you do.
[2021-04-16 03:39:37] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: You’re right but I get extremely depressed often
[2021-04-16 03:39:50] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: To the point that I want to die
[2021-04-16 03:40:00] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: I’m not suicidal though
[2021-04-16 03:41:21] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i understand that. i think there's a lot of stress and pain that comes with dysphoria that almost makes death seem like a better option but it isn't.
[2021-04-16 03:44:01] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: ok here are some other websites that i've found that might helps:
Trans Lifeline: this is a hotline that is run by trans people to support and help other trans people
- https://translifeline.org/
TransMission: this is an organization that gives away scholarships to help fund expenses related to transitioning
- https://www.loftgaycenter.org/transmission
Point of Pride: same website as last with the shapewear but this includes covering HRT costs and surgery costs
- https://pointofpride.org/hrt-access-fund/
- https://pointofpride.org/annual-transgender-surgery-fund/
[2021-04-16 03:47:30] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: Thank you

[2021-04-16 03:47:40] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: I need to sleep now
[2021-04-16 03:47:45] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: I appreciate your help
[2021-04-16 03:47:56] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: this ticket does get deleted so i could copy the link i sent
[2021-04-16 03:48:22] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: or i can dm you them if you would like
[2021-04-16 03:52:55] (423442548351041538) rocephin#5097: DM would be best
[2021-04-16 03:53:18] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: alright i'll send it then
[2021-04-16 03:53:24] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: am i alright to close the ticket otherwise?
