[2021-04-13 04:43:43] (806892800301727775) PðŸŒ±#3042: Hello!  I am 20+, Greenwich time,  Iâ€™m available 24/7 at the moment and whilst I donâ€™t expect that to change I can notify mods in advance anyway, I have no triggers.
[2021-04-13 04:44:09] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: awesome thank you for that information.
[2021-04-13 04:44:47] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: iâ€™m gonna run a simulation with you where i would act like an user that would open a ticket and you respond in what manner you feel is best.
[2021-04-13 04:45:08] (806892800301727775) PðŸŒ±#3042: Oh damn hey!! Letâ€™s do it ðŸ™‚
[2021-04-13 04:47:08] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i like the enthusiasm haha
[2021-04-13 04:51:19] (806892800301727775) PðŸŒ±#3042: Tbh I feel this system is easier for me to help people rather than me missing their @ in support or something!
[2021-04-13 04:53:11] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: you'll still get a ping that a ticket has opened but private support is structured in a way that ensures whatever ticket opens gets addressed by someone on the team whenever they're available to
[2021-04-13 04:57:03] (806892800301727775) PðŸŒ±#3042: Yeah I like to reply as soon as possible so I donâ€™t offer advice/support or help at the â€˜wrong timeâ€™ for a different way to explain it. As sometimes Iâ€™m aware hearing advice hours or days after an incident has happened can re open the whole rethinking aspect of it
[2021-04-13 04:57:45] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah. anyways i'm gonna start doing an simulation with you.
[2021-04-13 04:58:07] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: hi. iâ€™ve been struggling a lot with my depression lately but iâ€™m also getting these times where iâ€™m super energetic and feel invincible. do you think you tell me what that means?
[2021-04-13 05:04:17] (806892800301727775) PðŸŒ±#3042: Hey! sorry your depressions bringing you down recently, have you or are you able to speak with a doctor about it? Is there something in particular on your mind? And whilst I understand what you mean, I myself canâ€™t diagnose/tell you what your current feelings mean unfortunately but I can tell you if youâ€™re happy during these times then embrace it!!
[2021-04-13 05:06:02] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: no i haven't gone to a doctor for it. my mom said that i'm just making it all up. i just don't know what to do. i feel like no one believes me when i tell them something i wrong. i just feel so emotionally unstable all the time and i wish someone would help me.
[2021-04-13 05:11:21] (806892800301727775) PðŸŒ±#3042: Sorry your mum has reacted that way, is there another adult in your life who may understand or be able to listen to you that you trust? Ive learned itâ€™s not that people donâ€™t believe us, itâ€™s that they donâ€™t understand it, itâ€™s not your fault for the way things are and there are people who know that and will help, itâ€™s just finding them.
[2021-04-13 05:12:29] (806892800301727775) PðŸŒ±#3042: Where are you in the world? I can  find some helpful resources as local to you as possible for you to reach out to if thatâ€™s any help
[2021-04-13 05:16:08] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: no there isn't. my dad is always at work and siblings are at college so i can barely talk to them. i just feel alone.
[2021-04-13 05:16:17] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i'm in north america.
[2021-04-13 05:23:18] (806892800301727775) PðŸŒ±#3042: I see, you should be able to book a doctors appointment for yourself and if successful weâ€™ll work out how to get you there if needs be. If you can trust any of your siblings then leave them a note, a text anything they can just read telling them at the least you need some support mentally; so they can understand what youâ€™re going through, you donâ€™t have to do this alone honestly.  You can always @ support in our channels also just to remind you, someone will always be there on the other side to help pull you through it when you need them, just remember to reach out like you have this time. Do you spend much time on discord? Thereâ€™s a few positivity and general chat channels which you may like too!
[2021-04-13 05:24:10] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah i spend most of my time on here. i don't have a lot of friends at school so i don't really talk to anyone but on discord.
[2021-04-13 05:27:20] (806892800301727775) PðŸŒ±#3042: I understand, you can find some great friends online though to be honest and if youâ€™re happy thatâ€™s all that matters but school friends will always come and go anyway
[2021-04-13 05:28:23] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i guess. i feel so alone right now. i feel like no one cares. like i could just disappear and no one would notice that i was gone.
[2021-04-13 05:33:52] (806892800301727775) PðŸŒ±#3042: Sorry you feel youâ€™re alone but youâ€™re not, thereâ€™s people here for you whenever you need them, people that would notice their Jupiterâ€™s missing from their world I promise! You may not feel significant but you are important
[2021-04-13 05:35:21] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: ok thank you. i'll try and seek out a doctor.
[2021-04-13 05:42:10] (806892800301727775) PðŸŒ±#3042: That would be your best bet but for now remember whoâ€™s here for you when you need someone, I hope your depression eases the hell up on you soon and you can enjoy your day
[2021-04-13 05:42:59] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: anyways that concludes the simulation. that was an example of a type of situation you might face if you're chosen to be a private support member. we'll get back to you with our decision as soon as possible. i hope you enjoy your day.
[2021-04-13 05:44:37] (806892800301727775) PðŸŒ±#3042: Okay, thanks ðŸ™‚
