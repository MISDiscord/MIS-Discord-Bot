[2021-04-17 11:56:58] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: hey! <@!732879948645269586> give me a ping when youâ€™re around
[2021-04-17 11:57:07] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: oh uh hi, i'm here
[2021-04-17 11:57:11] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: what's the matter?
[2021-04-17 11:57:46] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: we just have a few questions for you ie any littles in your system in relation to moderation matters, if thatâ€™s okay?
[2021-04-17 11:57:59] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: oh yeah sure, ask ahead!
[2021-04-17 11:58:16] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: cool thank you! how many littles do you currently have in your system?
[2021-04-17 12:00:16] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: we have one who technically classifies as a little or young middle, she is relatively "mature" though if you can say that, she knows what things she can do and what she can't and one of us is almost always with her in case something comes up
[2021-04-17 12:01:35] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: and say for example she was fronting with another member, and some triggering content came up, how would this be dealt with within your system?
[2021-04-17 12:03:50] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: our caretaker/protector deals with those situations. we rarely have huge outwards reactions to triggers and we have coping methods, we also sometimes have to deal with triggering situations at work and from our experience there it has always worked out
[2021-04-17 12:05:39] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: and last one, do you have any overly protective aggressive alters that front when a user is getting aggressive, if so, how do you deal?
[2021-04-17 12:06:26] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: we don't really, no, we only have four alters, rhys is quite protective but he doesn't get agressive in those situations
[2021-04-17 12:08:47] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: thank you so much for your answers! weâ€™re gonna keep the ticket open for a little to see if anyone else has any questions for you if thatâ€™s okay!
[2021-04-17 12:09:36] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: alright, sure thing! we should hopefully be able to respond quickly ^^
[2021-04-17 16:03:19] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: <@!732879948645269586> ping me when you see this

[2021-04-17 16:07:58] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: Couple more questions for you.
[2021-04-17 16:08:09] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: If you could be any role colour, which would you be?
