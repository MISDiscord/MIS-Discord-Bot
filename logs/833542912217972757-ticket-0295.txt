[2021-04-19 03:26:58] (578626787547021312) 丂Ҝ乇ㄒ匚卄ㄚ#5025: me and my family and friends use "pillow talk" as when someone lies to you to make you feel better I feel that zemo was telling me those things to keep me happy instead of being genuine
[2021-04-19 03:31:24] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: thank you for explaining. i appreciate it. i've never heard "pillow talk" used in that manner personally and i think lots of others probably haven't either. i'm going to revoke the warning that was made, however, i just kindly ask that you refrain from using that term again in the server due to the fact that most associate it with nsfw concepts.
