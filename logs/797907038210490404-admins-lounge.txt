[2021-04-15 19:48:21] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Sorry for the follow up announcement; we just wanted to clarify as well that we ask members to not go directly to mods asking about the status of their application, as that is not information we are able to disclose. Rather than having specific "application times", this link is perpetually open, meaning you are free to apply at any time. With that being said, we also do not have set deadlines or a quota of new members to add to the team, and therefore process applicants on a rolling basis, only promoting additional staff after the team has come to a consensus, and we feel that the member would fit in well. If you are chosen, we will privately reach out to you to confirm you are still interested, and then proceed from there, but otherwise, please do not message the mods about it.
[2021-04-15 19:48:23] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: how does this sound

[2021-04-15 19:55:05] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: wait are you gonna mention the “don’t apply unless you’re active”
[2021-04-15 19:55:41] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: probably not
[2021-04-15 19:55:59] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Because they could become active later

[2021-04-15 19:57:22] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: i think it's a good idea just to see like
[2021-04-15 19:57:36] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: like if someone applies and isn't at all active i think that's a bit sketchy in the first place lol
[2021-04-15 19:57:40] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: like what were you thinking?

[2021-04-15 19:58:15] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: because if they’re the opposite of all of us then it might throw off the dynamic

[2021-04-17 17:10:02] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah so i think we're good
[2021-04-17 17:10:10] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: okie good phew
[2021-04-17 19:02:57] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I think for this round of trial mods we need to do more testing of what they think and stuff
[2021-04-17 19:04:50] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i would rather stay out of that personally
[2021-04-17 19:05:04] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Why?
[2021-04-17 19:05:29] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Do you think we should just let them do their thing?
[2021-04-17 19:06:03] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i think testing them is a great idea, but i personally wont be
[2021-04-17 19:07:21] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Alrighty
[2021-04-17 19:11:28] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i’m willing to do it
[2021-04-17 19:11:54] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I don’t mind

[2021-04-18 00:09:06] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: *didnt rodger already apply*

[2021-04-18 10:00:55] (821012679816249424) Avery | Library Collective#3148: application 2 electric boogaloo
[2021-04-18 10:01:21] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Might be a new one idk?
[2021-04-18 10:01:56] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: I don’t recall seeing it the first time
[2021-04-18 10:04:20] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: The app doesn’t look that bad tbh
[2021-04-19 02:54:49] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: weehehe has revoked her app
[2021-04-19 17:56:20] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i think they've been here for less than a week
[2021-04-19 17:58:48] (821012679816249424) Avery | Library Collective#3148: yeah they joined 6 days ago
[2021-04-19 18:01:42] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: they also wanna do giveaways and we don’t allow that

[2021-04-19 18:34:12] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: ok so personally i don't like leo's or rodger's
[2021-04-19 18:34:48] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: rodger's has more to do with knowing he once said to me that he doesn't feel comfortable calling people out when they do something against the rules
[2021-04-19 18:35:44] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: the whole purpose of a mod is to call people out
[2021-04-19 19:14:49] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: *~~that's why i dont like calling people out~~*
[2021-04-20 23:00:31] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: thoughts on the new mods so far? as in their modding abilities

[2021-04-20 23:09:06] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i think emeri had exams the last two days from what i know
[2021-04-20 23:09:38] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: ahhh that makes sense, i’m glad they’re focusing on their work

[2021-04-20 23:13:22] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: no problem
[2021-04-21 21:17:55] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: What do we think about Amanda’s app?
