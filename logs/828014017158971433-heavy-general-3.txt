[2021-04-21 00:21:19] (680825766346358814) Rozalera#0664: hey ive been thinking whether its a good idea to chat on here. i hope this can help. for lots of my life, ive felt dissatified. in that things were not always what i expected. especially when it comes socially. i think the reason is because im incapiable of maintaining relationships & friendships. I've been to 10 schools in 3 states and all resulted in the same way; me being an outcast, having very few or no friends and ||getting targetted on by bullies||It's hard not to believe that I'm not deserving of good relationships. but to start out i was living with parents ||who verbally abused each other daily|| and i didn't realize it was ||verbal abuse til my dad got his tumor and my mother got angry at him|| . they didn't ||divorce|| til i was 17. 

and you know what my mom said to me in the divorce court? "||I've been waiting this day since you were 4 years old||" I didn't know what to think at first but now I realize that I don't know what a good relationship looks like, or if I will ever learn that. It's not like I tried finding one though. 
I've had a boyfriend for a year in high school but now looking back at it ||he might've gaslit me a couple of times by getting angry at me for my actions caused by my eating disorder. but it's not to say i was a bad gf as well. I'd cry at random times, and I still do.|| With the divorce and the breakup and the pandemic all happening at the same time, ||I wasnt living, i was existing. i just became numb.|| Until my friend texts me and asks to hang out with him. I met a guy through one of mutual friends (both don't talk to me anymore) to sum it off, ||He was looking for someone to have sex with, and I gladly took it. at first it was nice but it quickly became forceful. He didn't take my word "no" seriously, which lead to sexual assault and my final two friends cutting me off. 2 months after that I had two suicide attempts in one week, but I wasn't taken to the hospital, there were simply not enough hospital beds.||
[2021-04-21 00:22:59] (680825766346358814) Rozalera#0664: ||I still blame myself for the years of bullying, feeling like an outsider, and even the sexual assault because there's someone wrong with me. there just has to be after I was given 10 times to start over.||
[2021-04-21 00:23:17] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: please censor ||pandemic||
[2021-04-21 00:24:32] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i’m really sorry you went through all of that. you’re very strong for getting through all of it. are you seeing a therapist to help cope with all the ||trauma|| you’ve experienced?
[2021-04-21 00:25:07] (680825766346358814) Rozalera#0664: i can only see her once a week for 30 minutes
