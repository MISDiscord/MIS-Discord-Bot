[2021-04-21 00:21:19] (680825766346358814) Rozalera#0664: hey ive been thinking whether its a good idea to chat on here. i hope this can help. for lots of my life, ive felt dissatified. in that things were not always what i expected. especially when it comes socially. i think the reason is because im incapiable of maintaining relationships & friendships. I've been to 10 schools in 3 states and all resulted in the same way; me being an outcast, having very few or no friends and ||getting targetted on by bullies||It's hard not to believe that I'm not deserving of good relationships. but to start out i was living with parents ||who verbally abused each other daily|| and i didn't realize it was ||verbal abuse til my dad got his tumor and my mother got angry at him|| . they didn't ||divorce|| til i was 17. 

and you know what my mom said to me in the divorce court? "||I've been waiting this day since you were 4 years old||" I didn't know what to think at first but now I realize that I don't know what a good relationship looks like, or if I will ever learn that. It's not like I tried finding one though. 
I've had a boyfriend for a year in high school but now looking back at it ||he might've gaslit me a couple of times by getting angry at me for my actions caused by my eating disorder. but it's not to say i was a bad gf as well. I'd cry at random times, and I still do.|| With the divorce and the breakup and the pandemic all happening at the same time, ||I wasnt living, i was existing. i just became numb.|| Until my friend texts me and asks to hang out with him. I met a guy through one of mutual friends (both don't talk to me anymore) to sum it off, ||He was looking for someone to have sex with, and I gladly took it. at first it was nice but it quickly became forceful. He didn't take my word "no" seriously, which lead to sexual assault and my final two friends cutting me off. 2 months after that I had two suicide attempts in one week, but I wasn't taken to the hospital, there were simply not enough hospital beds.||
[2021-04-21 00:22:59] (680825766346358814) Rozalera#0664: ||I still blame myself for the years of bullying, feeling like an outsider, and even the sexual assault because there's someone wrong with me. there just has to be after I was given 10 times to start over.||

[2021-04-27 18:11:40] (648312904940257281) Simo#0999: I find trigger warnings weird
if I say "tw ||apple talk||" that might be just as triggering as ||"I ate an apple"||. I'm not sure how else to put it
[2021-04-27 18:13:04] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: hmm do you mean that you need help figuring out what to put for tw?
[2021-04-27 18:14:33] (648312904940257281) Simo#0999: no
[2021-04-27 18:14:48] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: My b
[2021-04-27 18:16:09] (648312904940257281) Simo#0999: I was using apples as an example because I didn't want to bring up actual triggers
[2021-04-27 18:16:16] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: No yeah of course!
[2021-04-27 18:17:27] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I just meant that if you needed help with that sort of thing then I could help. But I get what you mean now. You're asking how a tw is effective if the said trigger is mentioned prior to the usage of the trigger, right?
[2021-04-27 18:20:27] (648312904940257281) Simo#0999: I might have found reasoning
saying "||go fuck yourself||" is seen as an insult, but "||fuck||" isn't
I'm not sure how else to describe it besides "context is important"
[2021-04-27 18:22:09] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: That is true. It's also true in the sense that before the cursing, you would put (tw ||cursing||) before using said expletive, so it generalizes enough to let the viewer know what they *might* get triggered by, you know?
[2021-04-27 18:22:39] (648312904940257281) Simo#0999: yeah
[2021-04-27 18:23:28] (648312904940257281) Simo#0999: ~~I fear~~
[2021-04-27 18:24:26] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: it's often also that if you put a tw for something, that thing is probably be mentioned a bunch/discussed in depth etc! if it's on twitter for example, some people just mute "TW" or certain triggers, so that those tweets dont even show up for them and i guess it was just kind of adapted from there

[2021-04-27 18:27:39] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: i can imagine, yeah ^^ speaking from personal experience here, for us triggers are usually only really heavy when it's mentioned a lot, so just one word wouldn't be as triggering as a whole discussion about it - let's say apples were a trigger for us, only the word apple wouldn't make us feel too comfortable but a whole convo revolving around apples would make us feel way worse, y'know?
[2021-04-27 18:28:47] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I definitely know what you mean. Similarly for me. I'm not triggered by a single use of a word, but a full discussion about interaction with said trigger would make me uncomfortable.
[2021-04-27 18:29:30] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Of course, <@!648312904940257281> , it's different for everyone though. So that's why on the server it's pretty much a general rule just in case! :>
