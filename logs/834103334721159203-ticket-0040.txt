[2021-04-20 16:29:42] (421837462047031297) Dkal#4012: Hello
[2021-04-20 16:31:15] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: So we’ve thought of an idea as a thank you to you all for boosting the server and we are letting you all pick the colour for the server booster role if you’d like to you would have to all agree on one colour and it can’t be the same shade as any of the displayed roles we have already and it can’t be purple (sorry that’s a lot of limits) would this be something you are all interested in?
[2021-04-20 16:31:42] (421837462047031297) Dkal#4012: Ooo hell yeah!
[2021-04-20 16:32:17] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: so if you’d like to all put colour suggestions in this channel :)
[2021-04-20 16:32:54] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: just a pre warning colours too close to pronoun roles will be rejected because we don’t want people to be misgendered
