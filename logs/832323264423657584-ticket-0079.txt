[2021-04-15 19:07:18] (583676874064920594) ㄥㄥ卂爪卂ㄥ卂山ㄚ乇尺#7674: school

[2021-04-15 19:07:56] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: yeah i totally get that, i personally find it difficult to balance school with everything else
[2021-04-15 19:09:44] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: if you want i can offer some things i do to make it easier :3?
[2021-04-15 19:09:56] (583676874064920594) ㄥㄥ卂爪卂ㄥ卂山ㄚ乇尺#7674: mhm?
[2021-04-15 19:12:56] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: normally what i do is set certain goals for the day, if i know i there’s something to work on i set a time and amount i want done, after i give myself time for a break/reward! 

example: 2 hours of hw (half my project) 
reward: episode of criminal minds 

i also recommended watching self care a bit closer! a shower/bath can help a lot! :3
[2021-04-15 19:15:05] (583676874064920594) ㄥㄥ卂爪卂ㄥ卂山ㄚ乇尺#7674: i struggle with motivation though
[2021-04-15 19:15:57] (583676874064920594) ㄥㄥ卂爪卂ㄥ卂山ㄚ乇尺#7674: (not that im asking you to answer it)
[2021-04-15 19:17:03] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: that’s kind of where the reward factor comes in! besides that setting a little goal first and then achieving it can help set some motivation!
[2021-04-15 19:18:20] (583676874064920594) ㄥㄥ卂爪卂ㄥ卂山ㄚ乇尺#7674: thats hard though as school is tiring so i go home watch youtube for 5 hours bam its 8pm , homework /project to still do but i couldve just watched more
[2021-04-15 19:18:49] (583676874064920594) ㄥㄥ卂爪卂ㄥ卂山ㄚ乇尺#7674: as ive passed it on to the next day yesterday
[2021-04-15 19:18:53] (583676874064920594) ㄥㄥ卂爪卂ㄥ卂山ㄚ乇尺#7674: why not do it today
[2021-04-15 19:19:09] (583676874064920594) ㄥㄥ卂爪卂ㄥ卂山ㄚ乇尺#7674: its obviously dumb but i cant help it
[2021-04-15 19:19:41] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: no i totally get it! i do that a lot too
[2021-04-15 19:21:06] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: it helps to set timers, youtube for an hour, work for a few hours, take a break/go for a walk, if needed do some more work if not you have free time to enjoy@
[2021-04-15 19:21:43] (583676874064920594) ㄥㄥ卂爪卂ㄥ卂山ㄚ乇尺#7674: yea but go and tell that to tomorrows me, his not gonna give a shit XD
[2021-04-15 19:22:39] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: it sounds a bit silly, but a schedule can help a lot, it can actually take a lot of stress off of school work
[2021-04-15 19:22:57] (583676874064920594) ㄥㄥ卂爪卂ㄥ卂山ㄚ乇尺#7674: ive made a schedule
[2021-04-15 19:23:00] (583676874064920594) ㄥㄥ卂爪卂ㄥ卂山ㄚ乇尺#7674: 2 weeks ago
[2021-04-15 19:24:31] (583676874064920594) ㄥㄥ卂爪卂ㄥ卂山ㄚ乇尺#7674: (but im going to go for a bit brb)
[2021-04-15 19:25:44] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: honestly it’s a matter of gaining motivation and sticking with it, if you work on school days you are more likely to have weekends off sort of deal
[2021-04-15 19:25:57] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: feel free to ping me if you want to continue talking ^^
