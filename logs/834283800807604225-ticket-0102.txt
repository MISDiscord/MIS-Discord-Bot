[2021-04-21 04:26:47] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Hey obsi what is going on tonight.
[2021-04-21 04:27:30] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: hey again
[2021-04-21 04:28:49] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: What can I help you with tonight
[2021-04-21 04:35:28] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: well someone was already helping me but they had to leave
[2021-04-21 04:35:37] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: same thing
[2021-04-21 04:35:38] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Oh okay
[2021-04-21 04:35:49] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: still trying to decide what to do
[2021-04-21 04:36:23] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: but there's one thing i haven't touched on
[2021-04-21 04:36:36] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Ahh okay go for it
[2021-04-21 04:36:56] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: the reason i joined this server was because I heard it was also lgbt
[2021-04-21 04:37:11] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: i've been questioning all of that since the past few years
[2021-04-21 04:37:22] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: and it doesn't help that BOTH my parents are homophobic
[2021-04-21 04:37:31] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: i don't think i'm hetero
[2021-04-21 04:37:38] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Okay
[2021-04-21 04:38:08] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Well do you want help figuring it out or talking to your parents
[2021-04-21 04:38:22] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: not anytime soon with my parents
[2021-04-21 04:38:23] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Or both
[2021-04-21 04:38:34] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Okay makes sense
[2021-04-21 04:40:09] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Well a good place to start if you want information on different sexualities is in <#827957348873928744>
[2021-04-21 04:40:44] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: well i mean
[2021-04-21 04:40:54] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: i have a sort of disgust with my genitalia and i've always seen other girls as attractive and I think i've had crushes on them before
[2021-04-21 04:41:22] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: what do you think that might mean?
[2021-04-21 04:42:56] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Okay well let’s start with the first part do you dislike it as in you want to be the opposite gender completely or do you feel more like you don’t have a specific gender
[2021-04-21 04:43:15] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: the ladder
[2021-04-21 04:46:36] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Okay so there are a couple ways people work through this is by looking into xenogengers
[2021-04-21 04:47:20] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: That refers to anything along the lines of non-binary
[2021-04-21 04:48:50] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: if i'm non binary what would that man for my sexuality?
[2021-04-21 04:49:57] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: So I know you said you are attracted to woman
[2021-04-21 04:50:15] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: How do you feel about men
[2021-04-21 04:50:35] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: pretty much the same
[2021-04-21 04:50:59] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Okay what about some who is trans
[2021-04-21 04:52:43] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: i don't know anyone who's trans but I don't see them very different at all, I think I can pretty much like anyone
[2021-04-21 04:53:52] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Okay so I would say that is a pansexual tendency then
[2021-04-21 04:54:21] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Because you are attracted to anyone no matter how they look
[2021-04-21 04:56:19] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: i mean obviously i have preferences for physical features would that still mean I could be pan?
[2021-04-21 04:57:05] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Yes
[2021-04-21 04:59:12] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: also I don't really care what someone calls me she/he/they, doesn't matter to me but I do see myself as genderless, in the middle of femininity and masculinity
[2021-04-21 04:59:47] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: That is usually referred to as non-binary
[2021-04-21 05:01:44] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: i think i'm definitely non binary but i'm still figuring out if i'm pan
[2021-04-21 05:02:19] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: i mean if I found the right person female/male/trans, whatever i don't care what they are. I could see myself spending all my life with them
[2021-04-21 05:02:33] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: That is fine if you want to there is <#827957423573565450> as well
[2021-04-21 05:03:51] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: if i'm willing to spend all of my life with anyone regardless of their gender, does that mean i'm pan?
[2021-04-21 05:05:59] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: That is how I see it but realistically you define what any of it means to you.
[2021-04-21 05:07:08] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: you're right but anyways since i'm basically 100 percent sure i'm non binary how could I get past my homophobic parents?
[2021-04-21 05:08:24] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: What do you mean by getting past them
[2021-04-21 05:08:49] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Are you trying to leave or hide it or something else
[2021-04-21 05:11:02] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: well i don't think i'll ever admit i'm non binary or pan to them
[2021-04-21 05:11:11] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: but some of the things they say really hurt me
[2021-04-21 05:11:45] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: and the reason they're homophobic is because they're Christian and believe that being with someone who's not the opposite gender is wrong
[2021-04-21 05:11:55] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: so I don't see them every being un homophobic
[2021-04-21 05:13:05] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: I see how this can be a hard situation.
[2021-04-21 05:14:18] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Although I am catholic not Christian they are very close in beliefs. Maybe you could slowly point out how the pope has reacted to the lgbt community
[2021-04-21 05:15:00] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: It has all been positive and he calls on people to try and change their views as well
[2021-04-21 05:15:50] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: really? wow I didn't know that
[2021-04-21 05:17:14] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Yes there are a lot of videos of him discussing it on YouTube
[2021-04-21 05:18:35] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: well thank you for telling but there's one more thing that i'd like your view on
[2021-04-21 05:18:45] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Of course
[2021-04-21 05:20:27] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: should I continue to try to convince them about the moving thing? Or should I just let it go and deal with living with my mom, knowing I could have had a happier life somewhere else?
[2021-04-21 05:25:07] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Maybe it is worth having a sit down with all four of you to talk. Maybe you can try and figure out a way to have a break from the close proximity to your mom and slowly work together to make things better.
[2021-04-21 05:26:26] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: i see what are some things you think I could say to increase the chances for me?
[2021-04-21 05:27:27] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: i've already tried expressing how unhappy I am with her but they always seem to take her side on things which made me gave up a while ago on it
[2021-04-21 05:27:54] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: and my mom she already knews I tried to move in with them and whenever I bring it up she keeps switching between hot and cold
[2021-04-21 05:28:53] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Maybe explain how you are feeling well your lack of feelings because that can be a sign of mental burn out.
[2021-04-21 05:29:32] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: And explain that you need just a complete break and different atmosphere for a bit
[2021-04-21 05:30:42] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: that seems reasonable but how could I convey that now that my mom has done a complete turn around, and how can I switch it between temporary and permanent through time?
[2021-04-21 05:30:57] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: also i'm not asking too many questions am I?
[2021-04-21 05:31:12] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: You are good
[2021-04-21 05:33:16] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: And I would start with addressing it as a temporary situation and see how it goes. Then if it goes really well you can ask for another sit down to discuss making it more permanent.
[2021-04-21 05:37:20] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: thank you I really appreciate the opinion of everyone since it helps me to see things from a different angle
[2021-04-21 05:38:00] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: and what would you say about the complete turn around thing, won't they see bs since my mom is now improving. How can I make them understand my burnout and lack of love for her?
[2021-04-21 05:40:58] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Well you could put as you need time and space and space for your mom could be good for here while she is improving.
[2021-04-21 05:43:37] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: sounds reasonable but i'm afraid they'll continue to take my mom's side or find alternatives like they usually do, is their any way I can prevent that or do I have to have the stars align for me?
[2021-04-21 05:44:51] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: I think some of it may be making compromises and figuring out something that will hopefully satisfy everyone involved.
[2021-04-21 05:49:46] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: I think that's all the questions I have. Thank you for the advice, i find it really helpful. I have trouble believing in myself and I always anticipate the worst case scenario.
[2021-04-21 05:50:52] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Of course we are always here for you
[2021-04-21 05:51:13] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: would you have anymore advice for me? Since you generally have more experience than me
[2021-04-21 05:52:16] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Be true to you because ultimately you have to answer to answer to yourself
[2021-04-21 05:54:33] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Okay so if you ever need more help don’t be afraid to reach out we aren’t going anywhere anytime soon
[2021-04-21 05:56:12] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: thank you for everything, it was really helpful
[2021-04-21 05:57:10] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Good I am glad if that is all I am going to go ahead and close the ticket.
[2021-04-21 05:59:02] (645507952144285716) obsi#8380: alright talk to you later
