[2021-04-13 03:00:02] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: first, i don't know how old you are but is there a possibility for you to see a therapist regarding what you're going through?
second, that's definitely a situation that is hard to deal with. have you tried talking to your friends about how you feel and ask them if they can assure you that they don't hate you?
[2021-04-13 03:01:02] (693627074212265994) birdz#2520: im 17 i thought about it but my moms dramatic and she'd make a big deal about it

[2021-04-13 03:01:41] (693627074212265994) birdz#2520: idk why i pushed all of them away
[2021-04-13 03:03:17] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i understand feeling like a parent will make a big deal out of it, however, the outcome would be very beneficial for you since it means that you can get professional help for your anxiety. my therapist has helped me a lot with rationalizing my anxious thoughts.
[2021-04-13 03:03:50] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: have you tried talking to them about what you're going through so they know that it isn't their fault but rather something out of your control?
[2021-04-13 03:07:17] (693627074212265994) birdz#2520: ig im just scared as always
[2021-04-13 03:07:56] (693627074212265994) birdz#2520: like spent 30 minutes trying going back and on weather or not to joinb the server
[2021-04-13 03:08:24] (693627074212265994) birdz#2520: idk if that helps describe me and my malfunctioning ways lol
[2021-04-13 03:10:32] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i get that. i know how hard it can make decisions like that but sometimes we have to rationalize our anxiety and realize that having conversations about your mental health is important to your future wellbeing.
[2021-04-13 03:12:03] (693627074212265994) birdz#2520: i know i have to its just hard idk what happened to me i used to be the loudest guy in the room always joking now i can barely even ask my coworker for help moving something
[2021-04-13 03:12:38] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: have you tried writing how down what you want to say in advance so that you have your thoughts organized regarding it?
[2021-04-13 03:13:53] (693627074212265994) birdz#2520: yeah it goes good for a few days then it gets really negaative then i get mad at myself and i get embaressed and throw the whole notebook away
[2021-04-13 03:14:48] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: have you tried taking a break when you notice that it's getting negative and practice a different coping technique instead?
[2021-04-14 02:35:07] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: <@!693627074212265994> you never responded so i wanted to check if you are alright
