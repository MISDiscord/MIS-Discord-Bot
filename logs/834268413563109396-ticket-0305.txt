[2021-04-21 03:31:52] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: The rules are in place so that it is a safe place **FOR ALL**, rules are made to provide that safe-haven for all members, because of the need for safety and protection for all people these rules are something that need to be looked at and reviewed before you verify. We have these rules in place for that reason and more, but these rules are known prior to entrance

When a rule is broken we simply as mods take action when necessary. There isn‚Äôt any wrong doing by asking people to follow rules when they‚Äôre broken
