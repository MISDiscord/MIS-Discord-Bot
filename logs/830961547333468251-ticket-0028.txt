[2021-04-12 00:31:07] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Hey kira we saw what you put in <#750376381019586651>, if there‚Äôs an issue or if you have any questions about your mute or strike you can bringing them up to mods. That ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù ||dead chat|| gif you sent unfortunately breaks our rules of what can and can‚Äôt be in <#824532627339083786>. Yes it‚Äôs a cool meme but that doesn‚Äôt belong at all in a LIGHT chat in a mental health server where there‚Äôs people dancing around lifting ||coffins||. While I don‚Äôt really have TW, there‚Äôs plenty of people that would go to <#824532627339083786>  and see that and be upset, triggered, and otherwise not be ok with what you posted. We have rules for a reason, I highly suggest you reread them, and I also suggest you don‚Äôt try to provoke any of the mods by saying the reason they muted you was for ‚Äúdaddy issues‚Äù. That‚Äôs pretty disrespectful to say to a mod. You‚Äôre more than welcome to comment and say what you need to, but know that that mute was absolutely 100% in reason.

[2021-04-12 00:36:55] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: when you got the notification about the first 12 hour mute, the reasoning was given "nsfw in non nsfw channel, not censoring words that need to be censored (5 strikes)"
[2021-04-12 00:37:12] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: and the people who you were talking to that night also got strikes

[2021-04-12 00:45:51] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i'm sorry but i can't close this ticket until i'm sure you will reread the <#701102417512628286>. you currently have 6 strikes and it would preferable if you didn't get more.

[2021-04-12 00:52:00] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i understand but saying the mods have daddy issues is not respectful.
