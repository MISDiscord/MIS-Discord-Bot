My current timezone is BST/GMT (I'm in the UK)
I'm able to take tickets most of the time after 4pm on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, and pretty much whenever at weekends.
I have no known triggers, but should any arise I do know how to manage such things.

[2021-04-20 17:01:21] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Just checking as it seems important.
[2021-04-20 17:02:20] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: You can begin when you're ready.
[2021-04-20 17:03:37] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: hey i had a really bad fight with my parents about 30 minutes ago and i left the house afterwards cause i was so upset. i don't want to go back but it's really cold outside and i have nowhere else to go.
[2021-04-20 17:04:19] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: I'm very sorry to hear that things are difficult for you at the moment.
[2021-04-20 17:04:33] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Do you have any friends or family members nearby that you could stay with?
[2021-04-20 17:05:17] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: no there's no one in the area. my siblings are all in college and my family members live in a different college.
[2021-04-20 17:06:19] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Are you a minor my friend?
[2021-04-20 17:06:30] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah i am. i'm 15.
[2021-04-20 17:06:34] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: I just need to know as it will help me determine who can help you find somewhere to stay.
[2021-04-20 17:06:40] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Ok, is it dark outside?
[2021-04-20 17:06:47] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: it's sunset.
[2021-04-20 17:07:20] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Do you think that it would be possible for you to try calling the police and telling them you're 15 and don't have anywhere to stay?
[2021-04-20 17:07:45] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: I don't want you to go back to your parents' house if there was a big fight, but I definitely need you to stay safe my friend.
[2021-04-20 17:08:37] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i don't want to call the police. i don't want my parents getting in trouble.
[2021-04-20 17:09:07] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: I see, it's perfectly understandable to not want people to get in trouble, but you still need to be safe.
[2021-04-20 17:09:30] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Has there ever been anything that's made you feel unsafe at home before, or so you just not want to go back because you're upset?
[2021-04-20 17:10:16] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i told my parents that i'm ||suicidal|| and they told me that i was faking it for attention
[2021-04-20 17:10:56] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: I see my friend, in that case can you try calling an ambulance.
[2021-04-20 17:11:20] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: They will keep you safe.
[2021-04-20 17:11:53] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: ok maybe. i'm just shaking so much and i can't think properly.
[2021-04-20 17:12:09] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Ok my friend, it's fine to be shaken
