Like self help books in particular, if someone is looking for a book on trying to improve gratitude for example they could ask. Or if someone just finished a good book that helped them they can share
[2021-04-09 17:33:30] (402850538116612097) Mikey#5199: If this already exists and I just missed it then plz let me know

[2021-04-11 21:48:38] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: the join process could have a much greater font, color, # or links.  Instead like  it appears to be buried in terms of service statement that most of us just browse. i suggest it be at top or have its own # directory
[2021-04-11 21:49:48] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Yeah thatâ€™s the point

[2021-04-11 21:50:40] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: Or it could unintentional turn away potential members

[2021-04-11 21:52:12] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: the people who dont put in the effort to read the rules would most likely be trolls or people who would constantly break them
