[2021-04-09 17:33:15] (402850538116612097) Mikey#5199: A suggestion I think would be good could be a  channel for book recs people have? Like self help books in particular, if someone is looking for a book on trying to improve gratitude for example they could ask. Or if someone just finished a good book that helped them they can share
[2021-04-09 17:33:30] (402850538116612097) Mikey#5199: If this already exists and I just missed it then plz let me know

[2021-04-11 21:48:38] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: the join process could have a much greater font, color, # or links.  Instead like  it appears to be buried in terms of service statement that most of us just browse. i suggest it be at top or have its own # directory
[2021-04-11 21:49:48] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Yeah that‚Äôs the point
[2021-04-11 21:50:00] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: It‚Äôs meant to encourage you to read the rules
[2021-04-11 21:50:40] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: Or it could unintentional turn away potential members

[2021-04-11 21:52:12] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: the people who dont put in the effort to read the rules would most likely be trolls or people who would constantly break them
[2021-04-11 21:53:04] (774040108051595324) Victor Oscar#8359: Not to argue, but it took me 10 minutes a DM to Lucy to know that
[2021-04-11 21:53:32] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Did you read the rules?

[2021-04-15 14:23:31] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: you can use <#816981072855695370> for that
[2021-04-15 14:30:36] (578626787547021312) ‰∏Ç“ú‰πá„ÑíÂåöÂçÑ„Ñö#5025: honestly book recommendations could be useful imagine you send a message in <#816981072855695370> waiting to recommend a book and it just gets ignored due someone else talking about music or something so A channel dedicated for recommending books sounds pretty awesome and useful why not just put it in and track it's activity and if it doesn't go well take it down
[2021-04-15 14:32:14] (779327825429004329) Certified_Goat#5214: that was my thought. but if they dont want to make one, what can ya do?
[2021-04-15 14:32:42] (578626787547021312) ‰∏Ç“ú‰πá„ÑíÂåöÂçÑ„Ñö#5025: make a valid point and try again like I just did
[2021-04-15 14:34:28] (779327825429004329) Certified_Goat#5214: yeah, my idea was like. just one specifically for books so that people looking for books can just go there rather than filtering through all the interests to find some books.

[2021-04-15 15:04:04] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: We had a channel dedicated to books, music etc but they weren‚Äôt used enough to need an entire channel each when we can merge it into <#816981072855695370> since this channel isn‚Äôt even really that active
[2021-04-15 15:05:55] (578626787547021312) ‰∏Ç“ú‰πá„ÑíÂåöÂçÑ„Ñö#5025: that's fair but how many users are in here since then and <#816981072855695370> I see at least a few messages daily
[2021-04-15 15:06:21] (443130730478960670) Alora ü•©#7138: (You can always use the search function in a specific channel to help find what you're looking for)
[2021-04-15 15:11:16] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: that message count you see in interests is only going to be split up if we create new, more niche channels. a activity won't increase, I've seen it in larger servers too where niche channels barely ever get used

[2021-04-19 12:19:17] (337011588273930241) TheFallenWarroir#1444: this is more of a question but im not sure where to put it
what if i made little emojis like nonverbal cards? just as an example, a bunny holding a sign that says "i believe in you!"
would that be good enough and useful?? im not exactly sure so i thought feedback might be nice
[2021-04-21 13:43:35] (347811547676016662) Jeeo#3171: ?suggestion Add an "Any pronouns" role. I think it would be helpful for folks, instead of just adding every pronoun to their roles.
