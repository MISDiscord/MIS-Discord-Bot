brief server description (eg. sfw mental-health safe space!)
specific target groups (eg. people with depression or certain mental disorders, people facing relationship problems): 
remarks (if any): can be more details on server,, eg. server theme - stuff that i will consider adding mostly to complete the aesthetic of the embed.

2. We are a mental health server where we provide one on one support sessions and a welcoming community for different creative outlets and mental illnesses. We have venting rooms, regular events, plenty of mental illness and vanity roles, and lots more. 
3. We want to partner in order to connect with more mental heath communities and thus let the members of both servers gain access to more mental health resources.
