Hey! We are the discord server for r/mentalillness we created this server as a way to form a community for people of all ages to talk about things and receive support as a community! We are a very tight knit community who loves to meet new people :)

We have lots of heavy channels from advice, venting, general or no response. 

We have channels for lots of things more than just mental health, we have physical health and lgbt inclusive channels and also channels for you to just chat about the things you love in.
it’s a plural and lgbt safe space.
