[2021-04-16 18:32:16] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: all good! so i’m actually in a super similar situation where i am mainly financially dependent on a person, at first i tried to resist and use whatever small amount of money to help and pay for things. but the more i tried the more they bought for me, so while they were at work i’d go and buy us food for the week or a little gift, and it really made them feel better for knowing i was safe, fed, and warm and being able to rely on them for support. for me it sucked and it was super scary, it did take me a while to even come to terms with it. but i know that they wouldn’t take you in if you didn’t mean the world to them and want you to be safe, fed and warm, and there might come a time where you do the same for them, after a while it definitely blends together and separate things become shared. what helped me was little surprises for them, like making a cake, making tea when they got home from work, little things that were good for you both but shows how grateful you are, it helps with the guilt a little. but i’m sorry you’re going through this. they seem to care for you lots and i’m super glad you have your partner system, they sound lovely
[2021-04-16 18:39:58] (821012679816249424) Avery | Library Collective#3148: it's really reassuring to know that someone's experiencing similar things even though i'm really sorry you had/have to go through that <:hugs:771753710526267403> we'll definitely try that and just be there for them as much as we can and give them everything we can, it's just so overwhelming and feels like we're never gonna be able to repay them, not neccesarily in the money aspect but more just all the things they did and want to do for us. thank you so much for the advice, we'll definitely do that! really appreciate you taking the time to respond <:hugs:771753710526267403> it's calming to know that things worked out for you, i guess i just worry a lot about stuff
[2021-04-16 18:43:10] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: it’s okay to worry! talking it through with them can help also, sometimes it stops becoming a scale of what each of you have done for the other, but what you do for you all. i really hope it goes well and you can find a way to make everyone happy and stress less<a:hugs:801846621183803452>

[2021-04-20 20:02:29] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: so i do this called a daily mood log in therapy and it's essentially this worksheet where i have to write down thoughts i have about a specific issue, i'm literally doing one about my abandonment issues right now, and essentially what you do is look at your thoughts from a different perceptive 
so like "everyone leaves me" ---> "just because i've had people leave in the past does not mean everyone who comes into my life will"
or like "i'll never be the most important person to someone" ---> "it's ok not to someone's most important person. it doesn't mean they don't care about you"
[2021-04-20 20:02:32] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: ~~thats probably horrible wording~~

[2021-04-20 20:04:34] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: My brain things “ok” means people hate me sometimes
[2021-04-20 20:04:37] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: It’s not a vibe
[2021-04-20 20:05:06] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: but ok could also mean that the person has nothing more to add to the conversation for the time being
[2021-04-20 20:05:15] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: It could yes

[2021-04-20 20:06:19] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i know it's hard to believe sometimes
[2021-04-20 20:06:39] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: but if people didn't care they wouldn't keep talking to you

[2021-04-20 20:53:33] (821012679816249424) Avery | Library Collective#3148: i guess so, it just feels like i'm leaving them to deal on their own... jfc yeah i see what they said about me overthinking too much
[2021-04-20 20:54:27] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I don’t think you are leaving them it’s taking some well needed time so you can help them and make sure you are ok
[2021-04-20 20:55:00] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i know i'm not a system so i might not completely get it but i have my own tendency to do whatever i can to take care of others, often sacrificing my own needs to do it. even i need to take breaks. if i can't take care of myself then i can't probably take care of others, ya know?
[2021-04-20 20:55:52] (821012679816249424) Avery | Library Collective#3148: i guess that makes sense, yeah... idk, i'm gonna think about it some more... thank you guys though
