[2021-04-18 00:25:21] (704391930334937169) Queer.emo666#1787: I think an online friend (he's in this server) just commited suicide and I don't know what to do I'm panicking and I don't really have any triggers exept like loud noices (and gory pictues of animals/humans but I wouldn't know how that'd come in this convo)
[2021-04-18 00:25:48] (704391930334937169) Queer.emo666#1787: He hasn't responded in over an hour now and I'm so scared he's dead
[2021-04-18 00:28:36] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: hello! thank you for bringing up the concern, do you mind telling me the user of this person? just so we can keep an eye :0? 

for now if you can try to do some form of coping or breathing exercises i really recommend that

[2021-04-18 00:31:10] (704391930334937169) Queer.emo666#1787: But it's 2.30am with me rn and I'm really tired but I don't want to go to sleep in case they respond to me
[2021-04-18 00:32:58] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: if you can try to sleep, we have people who will be around to support them when they say something in chat ^^
[2021-04-18 00:33:46] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: try not to worry, they could also be asleep or busy with something!
[2021-04-18 00:33:48] (704391930334937169) Queer.emo666#1787: No but I meant in private chat's 
I kind of spammed him in the last hour since he stopped responding and went offline and I don't think he'll say anything in the server
[2021-04-18 00:34:40] (704391930334937169) Queer.emo666#1787: No he very clearly said to me that he should just kill himself and that I should move on with my life and when I tried to reason with him he said he was already dead on the inside and that was the last thing I heard from him
[2021-04-18 00:35:38] (704391930334937169) Queer.emo666#1787: Other people also had contact with him and to them he also mentioned he was going to kill himself
[2021-04-18 00:36:28] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: i understand, again try not to worry, if he shows up we will be here, i’m sorry you are going through this, we are trying our best to do what we can on our side here ^^
[2021-04-18 00:37:21] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: i understand you are worried, but we will keep you updated, the best thing you can do now is sleep
[2021-04-18 00:37:58] (704391930334937169) Queer.emo666#1787: I'm sorry for sounding rude but how on earth can I not worry now?? I cannot rest until I know he's safe! What if he just doesn't say anything in the server and contacts me privatly and I don't respond and he dies I can never forgive myself!! I can't sleep now
[2021-04-18 00:41:00] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: i understand completely but worrying won’t make him come online any faster, however, sleeping will help you and your mental health. so please try to sleep! we will watch for him very closely
[2021-04-18 00:41:58] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: nothing here would be your fault, rest is the best thing for you. a tired mind wouldn’t be able to help to the best anyway, and i doubt he would want you to hurt yourself out of worry
[2021-04-18 00:42:15] (704391930334937169) Queer.emo666#1787: I
[2021-04-18 00:43:49] (704391930334937169) Queer.emo666#1787: I'm not hurting myself with this, I'm used to it. And I get that you say you guys will watch him very closely (which I appriciate) but will you know when he dm's me? Will you notice when he's online? I know that it wouldn't be my fault but my brain will keep telling me that if he dies
[2021-04-18 00:46:52] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: mhms, i see your point. just out of my concern for you consider sleeping. if it makes you feel better mute everyone but him and turn your ringer on and if he texts you’ll hear it
[2021-04-18 00:47:46] (704391930334937169) Queer.emo666#1787: Yeah that's a smart idea, thank you. I think I'll stay awake for a while but I'll go to sleep within the next hour
[2021-04-18 00:47:51] (704391930334937169) Queer.emo666#1787: Or a bit later
[2021-04-18 00:49:29] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: i’m glad to hear, i hope sooner than later. would you like to keep the ticket open? or too close it and open a new one later if something arises?
[2021-04-18 00:49:46] (704391930334937169) Queer.emo666#1787: I would like to keep it open if that's okay with you
[2021-04-18 00:50:29] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: of course, feel free to ping me if you need anything, we will let you know if we hear something
[2021-04-18 00:50:55] (704391930334937169) Queer.emo666#1787: Thank you so much, yes ping me cuz I'm also going to mute this server in a way that I will get notifications if I get pinged
[2021-04-18 00:51:02] (704391930334937169) Queer.emo666#1787: Thanks again for the help
[2021-04-18 00:52:02] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: will do, of course, sweet dreams!
[2021-04-18 01:45:21] (704391930334937169) Queer.emo666#1787: Hey I just wanted to let you know he reached out to me and he didn't attempt yet but he still wants to
[2021-04-18 01:47:31] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: thank you for letting us know, if possible can you recommend to him to file a ticket?
[2021-04-18 01:52:44] (704391930334937169) Queer.emo666#1787: I'll try but I'm not really sure what his current mood is (he also told me he might go to sleep so I'm aiming for that rn)
[2021-04-18 01:55:15] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: for sure! please keep us updated ^^ it means a lot!

[2021-04-18 01:56:30] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: and please consider sleeping soon !
[2021-04-18 02:07:47] (704391930334937169) Queer.emo666#1787: If I can assure he's safe I won't be sleeping for a while I'm sorry😅
[2021-04-18 02:11:37] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: once again try to get him to make a ticket, or even call a hotline ^^
[2021-04-18 02:14:49] (704391930334937169) Queer.emo666#1787: He doesn't look like he's in immediate danger rn so I'll check again
[2021-04-18 02:26:25] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: if you don’t think he is you both could use some sleep
[2021-04-18 02:29:25] (704391930334937169) Queer.emo666#1787: Mabey you're right
[2021-04-18 02:29:35] (704391930334937169) Queer.emo666#1787: I am planning on sleeping soon
[2021-04-18 02:31:31] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: good to hear, i hope you both get some sleep, we will be around if either of you need anything

[2021-04-18 03:02:21] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: don’t worry about me it’s still pretty early :3! 9pm
