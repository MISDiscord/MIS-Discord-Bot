-do not ping private support if it's been less than two hours
-conversations should not exceed 2 hours 
-respect the private supporters since they are volunteers from the server
-let the private supporter close the ticket
(^^^ if you want to know my reasoning behind this, don't be afraid to ask and i'll be glad to explain)
