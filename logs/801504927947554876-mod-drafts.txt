[2021-04-09 03:14:08] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: **things to mention in the thing about private support:**
-do not ping private support if it's been less than two hours
-conversations should not exceed 2 hours 
-respect the private supporters since they are volunteers from the server
-let the private supporter close the ticket
(^^^ if you want to know my reasoning behind this, don't be afraid to ask and i'll be glad to explain)
[2021-04-09 16:31:09] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: @.announcement the mod team have decided to add a feedback channel where you can say things you like about the server such as channels, people, modding etc and things you would like to add this is a thing we have decided to implement for around a week to see what you like about the server :)
[2021-04-09 16:31:12] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: How does this sound?

[2021-04-11 17:50:18] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: Hey <@&705596937201516544>. This is announcement is just to bring everyone up to speed on some things going on behind the scenes regarding server events. 

Firstly, we would like to thank you all for participating in the events so far and for making them enjoyable each time. However I would like to ask that we don't hold any unofficial events like movie nights or quiz nights. You are free to play games with others in VC (obviously as long as its appropriate and abides by server rules) but for things like movies and quizzes a lot of effort goes into the organisation of them to make sure everyone is well informed so that everyone is safe and unofficial events can mess around with the behind the scenes organisation of said events. This is all so that everyone stays safe so we hope you understand. 

Secondly, I would like to have a set day for our weekly events so in the next message in this channel you will see a poll and I would like for you to vote for whichever day suits you best in a normal week. 

Thirdly, we're always looking for suggestions for games, movies and quiz topics so feel free to DM me <@!543871424188907544>  with any suggestions.

We are specifically looking for mods from any areas that are not in Europe or in the time zone EST because we have a lot of these already

[2021-04-16 20:06:58] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: __**MOD DM RULE**__

If you need to DM a mod in a mod-member manner we ask that you pay attention to our DM rules as you would for anyone else and it would be appreciated if you asked us if you could DM us anyways as we tend to get DMs from users a lot and it gets quite cluttered easily. When asking us if you can DM us please also give us the general topic of the DM. We will not carry out private support in DMs unless **both** parties consent to do so.
[2021-04-16 20:07:20] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: <@&793917061243994134> how does this look? this is just a rough thing so if theres anything that needs to be cleaned up let me know
[2021-04-16 20:07:52] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i think it might be good to mention where you can talk about mod related matters like private support and filing a ticket but other than that i like it!
[2021-04-16 20:08:21] (821012679816249424) Avery | Library Collective#3148: looks good, maybe specify that its fine to dm for non mod related stuff? (if they have dm open) just wanna make it extra clear cause people cant read
[2021-04-16 20:08:31] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: It’s very wordy
[2021-04-16 20:08:38] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: does the mod-member manner part not convey that?
[2021-04-16 20:08:46] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: if you can cut it down go for it
[2021-04-16 20:09:08] (821012679816249424) Avery | Library Collective#3148: it does but people cant read
[2021-04-16 20:09:40] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Maybe “if you need to dm a mod for non moderation issues we ask you respect dm roles”?

[2021-04-16 20:11:44] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Idk I feel like that kinda adds a fear that they can’t dm us for anything
[2021-04-16 20:12:14] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: well considering the amount of dms jupiter got what else can we do?
[2021-04-16 20:12:42] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: will i add on a part saying if its a friend-friend manner its fine?

__**Rules**__

**1**:  No self promotion or advertising
This includes linking to your own website, blog, fundraisers, or YouTube videos. Links from well known websites are allowed, but personal sites, blogs, surveys and polls are not.

**2**: The language of communication of this server is English. It's difficult to moderate other languages. Any user knowingly found communicating in any another language will have to face the consequences.

**3** : Keep things in the correct channels. Non mental health discussions regarding politics or religion are not allowed.

**4**: Please avoid minimodding. We appreciate efforts to help out, but more often than not it ends up interfering with our job, and can have unintended consequences.

**5**: Do not ask for or suggest a diagnosis
We are not doctors. Lists of symptoms mean nothing without seeing them in the context of your life. The most we can do is give advice for coping methods. Mental health is very important and you should seek professional help if you think something is wrong. 

**6** : Do not advocate for or against treatments
Leave the treatment for the professionals: do not prescribe treatments or suggest medication. You can describe how something worked for you, but please do not advocate for a form of treatment or a specific medication. 

**7**: No alternative medicine
Please do not promote religion, homeopathy, diets or any other form of treatment that does not have scientific backing. We are trying to help people.

**8**: Do not complain about a lack of responsiveness in heavy chats.
While we do want everyone to receive the assistance they need, and understand it can be frustrating to be seemingly ignored after a request for help, there are unfortunately some times of day where the server is relatively slow due to time zone restrictions. We do not want others to feel bad for not replying at a time they were unable to.
[2021-04-16 20:25:51] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: **9**: Respect DM roles.

**10**: Please refer to the list in #info-and-rules for trigger warnings and not allowed topics. Censor any words or phrases that fall within that list, and do not post about them in any light channels. 

**11**: Be civil and respectful
Racist, homophobic, transphobic, sexist or just generally offensive messages are not allowed. 

**12**: Do not encourage dangerous activities
Encouraging harmful or illegal activities is not okay. Advice to cease medication will be removed. Asking for medical advice concerning illicit drugs is forbidden. 

**13**: No NSFW messages out of <#706591269865914489>.

**14**: No graphic descriptions or details, specifically regarding eating disorders, self harm, or harm to others.

**15**: Moderators have final say: they're in the position for a reason. Unnecessarily argumentative behavior without valid justification will be met with an appropriate punishment.

**16**: If you need to DM a mod for a moderation issue we ask you to either respect DM roles and ask in the server with the general topic of the dm or create a ticket in <#808934814689918996>. We will not carry out private support in DMs unless **both** parties consent to do so. If you want to DM a mod in a friend-friend/non-server related manner please pay attention to our DM roles

Please file a ticket in <#808934814689918996> if you believe you have been wrongfully warned.

__How long do I have to submit my entry?__ 
<:PinkDot:801840466861621258> You have 1 week so submit your entries into <#808680755730841610> by the end of the 6th of May

__What's the prize?__
<:PinkDot:801840466861621258> As you may have guessed, the winner will have their emote added to the server!

[2021-04-27 08:09:02] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: But maybe because we need a winner we could do the top three?

We are doing this as there just doesn't seem to be much use for them and upkeep was too much for no usage. We, however, will still be holding our regular events and we have something very special to be announced tomorrow so keep an eye out!

When a rule is broken by a user, they receive a certain amount of strikes based on what rule was broken. The number of strikes a user has dictates the punishment they will receive. Strikes build on top of each other. Therefore if a user has existing strikes, add onto those when deciding what punishment is in order. 
<:PinkDot:801840466861621258> Rules 1 through 4 are 1 strike
<:PinkDot:801840466861621258> Rules 5 through 10 are 2 strikes
<:PinkDot:801840466861621258> Rules 11 through 15 are 3 strikes
<:PinkDot:801840466861621258> Rule 16 is 2 strikes

[2021-04-30 12:13:39] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: **__How to get roles__**
We here at r/mentalillness have a couple roles you can choose from for thing such as either your mental illnesses (preferably diagnosed) or thing you would like to be pinged/notified for. If you want to choose among the roles then head over to <#808934814689918996> and, starting from the top, react with the corresponding roles that would feel are appropriate for you. 

*Please note that some roles aren't allowed for certain members (NSFW and any role under 18 for example) and any attempt to falsify and work around this will result in a punishment*
