[2021-04-09 03:14:08] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: **things to mention in the thing about private support:**
-do not ping private support if it's been less than two hours
-conversations should not exceed 2 hours 
-respect the private supporters since they are volunteers from the server
-let the private supporter close the ticket
(^^^ if you want to know my reasoning behind this, don't be afraid to ask and i'll be glad to explain)
[2021-04-09 16:31:09] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: @.announcement the mod team have decided to add a feedback channel where you can say things you like about the server such as channels, people, modding etc and things you would like to add this is a thing we have decided to implement for around a week to see what you like about the server :)

[2021-04-11 17:50:18] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: Hey <@&705596937201516544>. This is announcement is just to bring everyone up to speed on some things going on behind the scenes regarding server events. 

Firstly, we would like to thank you all for participating in the events so far and for making them enjoyable each time. However I would like to ask that we don't hold any unofficial events like movie nights or quiz nights. You are free to play games with others in VC (obviously as long as its appropriate and abides by server rules) but for things like movies and quizzes a lot of effort goes into the organisation of them to make sure everyone is well informed so that everyone is safe and unofficial events can mess around with the behind the scenes organisation of said events. This is all so that everyone stays safe so we hope you understand. 

Secondly, I would like to have a set day for our weekly events so in the next message in this channel you will see a poll and I would like for you to vote for whichever day suits you best in a normal week. 

Thirdly, we're always looking for suggestions for games, movies and quiz topics so feel free to DM me <@!543871424188907544>  with any suggestions.
