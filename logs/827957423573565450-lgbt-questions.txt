[2021-04-14 15:34:28] (820071609683148801) Lilac_cat#5631: Lately I have been very confused about my sexuality and I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice. Recently I have been seeing girls in a new way and that really confused me. I still mostly like boys but im not sure why sometimes I look at girls differently now. Can anyone help me?

[2021-04-14 15:36:05] (820071609683148801) Lilac_cat#5631: thats what I have been thinking too but im so confused and im also new to all of this

[2021-04-14 15:39:33] (799410612333182996) TheFrostQueen❄#7887: It’s a very personal, sensitive subject, even if you decide not to tell them, you are still valid. It is scary, and it is hard to navigate those feelings...you will always have support here

[2021-04-14 15:45:17] (799410612333182996) TheFrostQueen❄#7887: It is not bad at all. Safety is important, and if you feel they would not support you, then whatever you decide is perfectly ok. You are valid either way❤️
[2021-04-14 15:45:31] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Definitely not

[2021-04-15 14:40:50] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I mean, maybe try introducing other people or media who are lgbtq+ to her and see how she reacts to that? But honestly, it's up to you if you want to come out. You don't have to (especially if you don't feel safe) and you shouldn't feel pressured to do so.
[2021-04-15 18:36:02] (714866901741862973) Byama#3003: Hey y’all I haven’t come out to a few of my friends yet so I wanted to ask how I possibly could? If anyone has any funny bisexual coming out things to say or whatever I’d love to hear them!!

[2021-04-16 20:37:51] (775066414242463808) Pigeon Queen#3514: I first tought I was bi but i was attracted like 98% girls and 2% guys maybe.. Then I tought Lesbian was for me, but non biney people...I have a big preference for girls but I don't want to reject someone because of their gender !
[2021-04-16 20:39:17] (758246297060376588) CauliflowerCerberus#8503: You could always go with the label queer
[2021-04-16 20:39:54] (758246297060376588) CauliflowerCerberus#8503: It’s more general and isn’t much of a box but still a label

[2021-04-16 20:41:36] (775066414242463808) Pigeon Queen#3514: I feel like I need something specific.. To feel part of something.. Like if I go to pride, what flag could I have? The rainbow one is too vague

Maybe there is no box for me?
[2021-04-16 20:44:33] (758246297060376588) CauliflowerCerberus#8503: There is a queer flag. But hey you know you don’t have follow the strict definition of labels. You could pick one that sounds right but still love whoever you want
[2021-04-16 20:44:51] (758246297060376588) CauliflowerCerberus#8503: You aren’t straight you already are in a community
[2021-04-16 20:45:37] (758246297060376588) CauliflowerCerberus#8503: And there doesn’t have to be a box for you

[2021-04-16 20:48:15] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Just to say you can be bi and have preferences to genders that doesn’t invalidate your sexuality I’m bisexual but I’m more into females than males (but I don’t particularly care for genders either way but yeah)
[2021-04-16 20:48:18] (437273191908376576) ReeyA#7915: exactly, and i also believe that sexuality is a spectrum and it can change
[2021-04-16 20:49:44] (775066414242463808) Pigeon Queen#3514: The only thing I'm sure of, is that girls give me butterflies 🥰

[2021-04-16 21:11:29] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: That's really hard alot of the time you just kinda know your not straight so you go looking for lables and one just seems right or closer to right then straight... Its really hard to figure out and different for all poeple
[2021-04-16 21:12:37] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: some poeple get to that point with experiance and others just kinda know, just know there is no right or wrong way to figure this out and however you figure it out is how it happens

I’m also aromantic which also explained why I didn’t know what romance was or never felt it.
[2021-04-16 21:20:15] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: Yah I feel that Im kind ace and aro fluid (like the way I like someone kinda changes)

[2021-04-16 21:43:53] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: some poeple do feel a little romantic attraction to that person but not alot

[2021-04-17 00:16:41] (654503227051474977) ghostproductions#4913: No because nobody should hate anyone or assume anything about anyone based on something they can’t control
[2021-04-17 00:16:56] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Yeah, doesn't make sense. We're not competing for the same resources.
[2021-04-17 00:18:22] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Look up the 'gay uncle' theory. Homosexuality has advantages, specifically because homosexual people are competing for different resources.

[2021-04-17 18:54:57] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: how can you be trans and non binary at the same time? i have a trans friend and he indentifies as trans non binary but im confused
[2021-04-17 18:55:23] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: isnt the whole point of being trans is switching from one gender to the other?
[2021-04-17 18:56:46] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: he said he doesnt understand it himself
[2021-04-17 18:57:06] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: a lot of trans people are in the gender binary but being trans basically just means identifying with a gender other than the one assigned to you at birth. the white flag on the trans flag stands for nonbinary gender identites and trans is generally an umbrella term for anything not cis
[2021-04-17 18:57:50] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: oh so trans doesnt only mean ftm or mtf?
[2021-04-17 18:58:10] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: nope! anyone who isn't cis can use the term trans
[2021-04-17 18:58:17] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: really? i see
[2021-04-17 18:58:24] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: huh
[2021-04-17 18:58:27] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: interesting
[2021-04-17 18:59:13] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: what about like xenogenders and stuff like that
[2021-04-17 18:59:16] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: is that trans too?
[2021-04-17 18:59:21] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: i dont understand those at all
[2021-04-17 18:59:52] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: it's honestly best to just ask people what terms they use for themselves
[2021-04-17 19:00:02] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: ah alright
[2021-04-17 19:00:21] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: its just hard for me to grasp
[2021-04-17 19:00:24] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: especially about xenogenders since those can be very specific to the person
[2021-04-17 19:00:51] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: its hard for me to grasp because for me theres only man and woman
[2021-04-17 19:01:05] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: idk its just how ive been brought up
[2021-04-17 19:01:31] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: so this whole spectrum thing is new to me

[2021-04-17 19:02:48] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: it's valid not to understand everything and nobody blames you for not understanding things immediately, however please refrain from saying that there are only men and women because it isn't true and very hurtful for people who don't fit into the gender binary
[2021-04-17 19:03:11] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: i dont mean to hurt anyonr
[2021-04-17 19:03:15] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: im just trying to understand

[2021-04-17 19:04:40] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: it’s important to separate the fact that gender is not sex, gender is how you want to be perceived/how you want to present!
[2021-04-17 19:04:48] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: huh okay
[2021-04-17 19:04:51] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: interesting
[2021-04-17 19:05:08] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: so sex is whats on the birth certificate and gender can be whatever?
[2021-04-17 19:05:58] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: basically yes, sex is the gender assigned to you at birth and gender is what you identify as and the two often overlap but not always
[2021-04-17 19:06:15] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: hm alright
[2021-04-17 19:08:20] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: thats new to me
[2021-04-17 19:10:12] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: it's new for a lot of people and nobody would blame you for not understanding something right off the bat! it's not the easiest thing to understand, the key is just to be understanding and respectful ^^
[2021-04-17 19:10:26] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: yeah im trying!

[2021-04-17 19:10:45] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: what ive always known
[2021-04-17 19:12:11] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: ive always been taught how like women have ||vaginas|| and men ||penises|| right? but i grew up in egypt so maybe thats why

[2021-04-18 02:47:06] (428653342999183370) keykey#0420: transgender's dictionary definition is: *"denoting or relating to a person whose sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond with their birth sex."* (from google) 

since nonbinary people do not always 100% of the time identify as their assigned sex at birth, nb people are inherently trans (though some nb people choose not to claim a trans identity and thats valid too!)

additionally the creator of the transgender flag has said the white stripe is for "those who are intersex, transitioning or consider themselves having a neutral or undefined gender." (neutral/undefined being non binary!) (i believe someone else already stated his oops)

non binary is also a spectrum– an umbrella term, as there's many ways to be non binary! some people just use non binary as an identity itself, though some also use more distinct descriptors like genderqueer, agender, demigender, genderfluid, etc!

[2021-04-20 00:54:41] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i mean i already use other sets of pronouns
[2021-04-20 00:54:48] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: per example my name

[2021-04-20 01:40:13] (825392044779503636) DinoDev#1621: Any way to be a femboy without the title “femboy”, femboy sounds too sexual in my opinion and most people would view it sexually.
[2021-04-20 01:40:53] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: honestly that

[2021-04-21 11:53:51] (437273191908376576) ReeyA#7915: but what is difference between pan and bi
[2021-04-21 12:00:04] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: it depends on the specifics for people, but pansexuality is like on the bi spectrum. Bi means two or more, but pan is more specific in that attraction is regardless of gender (even if preferences are present)
[2021-04-21 12:03:30] (437273191908376576) ReeyA#7915: i guess im pan lol

[2021-04-22 00:59:57] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: For a while I struggled accepting myself and honestly I'm still not sure what label fits me but tbh Idc abt that but I realized it doesnt matter. I know who I am and I like how I express my identity and that's all that matters
[2021-04-22 02:51:11] (733845646276165653) Linking_Dev#8658: Is it bad I don't support the LGBTQ+ community? I don't have anything against individual people and would never discriminate against anyone, I'm just sick and tired of all the constant LGBTQ propaganda getting shoved down my throat (pride month, LGBTQ parades, etc.).

I'm asking because I keep seeing LGBT people saying "just let us live our lives in peace" while going out of their way to promote their ideas and beliefs to everyone and then some, but when I speak up about it suddenly I'm a ||"homophobic, transphobic racist piece of garbage that should die in a hole"|| (and yes i've been called that before BY members of the lgbt community) just because I'm kind of tired of constantly seeing it everywhere, (it's like when slime was a huge trend on youtube, it was cool for the first month or two, then it was just annoying seeing it on the front page over and over again.)

Like keep in mind I would even bring this up if it wasn't for the extreme toxicity I've gotten, is this actually how people of the community think & feel? If so that's absolutely disgusting if they think that treating people like this is okay.

I don't care how people express themselves whatsoever, people can do whatever the heck they want and I couldn't care less, all I was asking was if I didn't support the "community" (I.E the fundamental ideas behind them), but **did** support individual people, (like for example, I run a small business and would never discriminate on one of my employees because they're LGBT) if that actually made me homophobic/transphobic??
[2021-04-22 03:00:45] (430621608877490186) Rodger#0283: Yeah if you identify as different pronouns then your assigned gender your apart of the lgbt

[2021-04-22 05:10:00] (85147068900847616) B3Y0ND#7326: I’m straight so I’m not the greatest with advice on these topics. I know it’s difficult though. But my sister in law had to do the same thing to her family. I think it shouldn’t matter what they think because it’s your life. If they don’t accept it, it’s their loss because at the end of the day, you’re still a person who is amazing in their own ways. If they miss out on that, then it’s their loss. Everyone is perfect, no matter who you are. It won’t be easy if you have a family who believes that way, but they can choose to accept it, because at the end of they day, you’re still a part of their family, so they have to live with it. If they don’t take it well, they lose. Because then they don’t get what they want. Families like that try to force people into being how they want them to be. I grew up with ||racist and homophobic|| parents who tried to mold me into a carbon copy of themselves. I decided one day that I had enough of it so I made my own decisions and they have to live with the fact that I’m not the way that they imagined me to be. Be proud of who you are. As long as you love yourself for who you are, then it doesn’t matter what other people think. 💛

Don’t be scared to be yourself because of your family.

The reason being is that I'm attracted to people that I want to look like. Like "You look really handsome, I want to look like you" type of thing. Does this make me a chaser? I respect trans people as I am one and don't objectify them, just sometimes I feel bad because I've only ever felt a pull towards them mostly
[2021-04-24 01:22:58] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: I don’t think so it is just a preference which is allowed

[2021-04-25 02:33:10] (467747778622259221) greywolfember#0072: of course it doesn't whether you're femme or masc or both or something else entirely etc. as far as whether you wanna make a corset out of metal can tabs

[2021-04-25 12:55:55] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: its not something that is concrete either, it can change as you find out more about yourself
[2021-04-25 18:30:39] (467747778622259221) greywolfember#0072: and just to weigh in a bit here! I think a bit of a better way to phrase this is pan is short for pansexual (adjective), which describes a person who feels sexual attraction regardless of gender -- so gender doesn't limit who they'll be sexually attracted to. depending on who you ask, you get different thoughts as far as the differences between bisexuality and pansexuality, though what I hear most often and what I also personally think is that pansexuality tends to have more of a "gender doesn't really matter in my sexual attraction consideration" and bisexuality is more "yes, I am attracted to all genders" -- but that's not true everywhere. labels are really meant to be descriptive and not prescriptive, so honestly doesn't really matter a ton in the large scheme. (and to keep following the train of thought, it might to some people, and that's great too, and so on :D). hope that helps!
[2021-04-25 18:30:46] (467747778622259221) greywolfember#0072: oh no I'm sorry I meant to remove the ping
[2021-04-25 18:30:48] (467747778622259221) greywolfember#0072: my bad
[2021-04-25 18:32:56] (467747778622259221) greywolfember#0072: and with this one, if you think you might be aro that's great! and if you think later you're not, that's great too! I'd like to clarify and say that aromanticism is about whether or not a person experiences romantic attraction. while many aro people don't want to get into a romantic relationship, just because you don't want to get into a romantic relationship doesn't necessarily mean you're aro. I'm not saying that you're not! just giving a more thorough description, in case it's helpful for you.

[2021-04-25 18:42:58] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: being aromatic isn't being gay. it's just part of the lgbt community.

[2021-04-26 20:23:51] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i have the same issue but with seeing myself as feminine. just try to do things that make you feel not masculine. sound similar said than done though.

[2021-04-27 18:41:58] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: it was created by some ||nazi troll|| on 4chan. it's basically a fancy term for ||transphobe||, and while yes, having preferences is completely fine, they are trying to turn it around and acting like they're the ||oppressed|| ones for being straight which is not th case. they're also not acknowledging trans people as their real gender/constantly misgender them. so yea, it's just ||transphobia|| but with another name
[2021-04-27 18:42:29] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: ah i get it
[2021-04-27 18:42:31] (648312904940257281) Simo#0999: ||super straight|| can be shortened to ||ss|| which also means ||Schutzstaffel||

[2021-04-27 18:54:21] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: my bad
[2021-04-27 18:54:26] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: dont take it personally!
[2021-04-27 18:54:30] (648312904940257281) Simo#0999: it's okay with me <:lots_of_love:712348017453432902>
[2021-04-27 18:54:49] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: oh yeah
[2021-04-27 18:55:02] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: we had a discussion about gender neutral bathrooms in class the other day
[2021-04-27 18:55:09] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: how do you guys feel about that
[2021-04-27 18:55:21] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: imo if anything there should be 3 bathrooms
[2021-04-27 18:55:29] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: men/women + neutral
[2021-04-27 18:55:50] (683424103897497673) Я ем пицца и пюре#8553: I kinda agree with that? I think so at least
[2021-04-27 18:56:02] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: i just wouldnt feel comfortable if men were in my bathroom. maybe thats due to trauma
[2021-04-27 18:56:12] (648312904940257281) Simo#0999: question
if you don't know someone's pronouns, is it better to use they/them, pronouns for their gender assigned at birth, or not use pronouns?
[2021-04-27 18:56:22] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: i get really anxious in public bathrooms
[2021-04-27 18:56:24] (807280172431573003) lana del ray (they/them)#5038: i cant really say because im like young to enter the mens bathroom
[2021-04-27 18:56:50] (807280172431573003) lana del ray (they/them)#5038: ive always just used the womans but i would never just use the public bathroom
[2021-04-27 18:56:52] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: i'd say it'd be best to avoid pronouns for th most part, use they/them if neccessary and ask them as soon as possible?
[2021-04-27 18:57:10] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: samee
[2021-04-27 18:57:25] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: tbh i just use he online and irl whatever my brain defaults to
[2021-04-27 18:57:35] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: whatever this person is presenting as
[2021-04-27 18:57:44] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: and if they tell me "hey i want to be called this"
[2021-04-27 18:57:46] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: yeah ok

[2021-04-27 18:58:30] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: what i cant wrap my head around is like, neopronouns
[2021-04-27 18:58:37] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: i never understood those
[2021-04-27 18:58:43] (648312904940257281) Simo#0999: I get really anxous when I think I'm about to use the wrong pronouns
[2021-04-27 18:58:55] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: but i havent met anyone who uses those 🤷‍♀️
[2021-04-27 18:59:10] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: you could also ask

[2021-04-27 18:59:23] (648312904940257281) Simo#0999: ?
[2021-04-27 18:59:49] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: you could ask for their pronouns
[2021-04-27 18:59:53] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: what they go by
[2021-04-27 18:59:56] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: before saying
[2021-04-27 19:00:00] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: I use only neopronouns-
[2021-04-27 19:00:25] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: what helps me for neopronouns is to imagine the sentence with a "placeholder pronoun", so to say, and then just replace those with the right neos
[2021-04-27 19:00:42] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: hm alright
[2021-04-27 19:00:47] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: do people irl use those?
[2021-04-27 19:00:51] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: or is that an online thing

[2021-04-27 19:03:09] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: unless youre actively trying to
[2021-04-27 19:03:24] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: yeah, body's female and we present as female so we don't really mind being called she/her irl even for the alters who don't go by those, since they cant know better
[2021-04-27 19:03:39] (807280172431573003) lana del ray (they/them)#5038: yeah.
[2021-04-27 19:04:22] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: Our body is female and we present as.. anything besides female.

[2021-04-27 19:05:30] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: do people take medication for that or how do you help it?
[2021-04-27 19:05:36] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: medication helps me alot
[2021-04-27 19:06:03] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: no meds, testosterone or estrogen could help though in some situations.
[2021-04-27 19:06:13] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: It depends on the person. If you mean hormones by meds, then yeah, a lot of people use hormones but some don't
[2021-04-27 19:06:13] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: arent those hormones?

[2021-04-28 01:25:27] (732057094148194405) snuffy#8130: I believe it is similar to pansexual but don’t quote me on that, I’m not sure myself.
[2021-04-28 01:30:06] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: omnisexual is very similar to pansexual, however pansexual is liking people regardless of gender (preference can still be there) and omnisexual is liking people while being aware of gender 

however both are just labels and at the end of the day it’s okay if they change, it’s whatever you are comfortable with
[2021-04-28 19:48:05] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: wait if i'm attracted to something that looks like women and feels like woman but is a man is that gae

[2021-04-28 19:51:26] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: well i look at something that looks like a woman and sounds like one and is a dude and i'm atracted to it does that mean something
[2021-04-28 19:52:08] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yes because they're a guy? /lh
[2021-04-28 19:54:15] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: also please don't call them it unless they use it/its pronouns
[2021-04-28 19:59:03] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: We do not know of the person's gender, but if you're attracted to the person, then there's nothing to question about it.
We know literally nothing about the person, so I can't really tell you what sexuality you would have, but it also isn't of great importance. Love is love, life is life. You don't have to label yourself immediatly.
