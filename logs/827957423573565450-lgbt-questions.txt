[2021-04-14 15:34:28] (820071609683148801) Lilac_cat#5631: Lately I have been very confused about my sexuality and I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice. Recently I have been seeing girls in a new way and that really confused me. I still mostly like boys but im not sure why sometimes I look at girls differently now. Can anyone help me?

[2021-04-14 15:39:33] (799410612333182996) TheFrostQueen❄#7887: It’s a very personal, sensitive subject, even if you decide not to tell them, you are still valid. It is scary, and it is hard to navigate those feelings...you will always have support here

[2021-04-14 15:45:17] (799410612333182996) TheFrostQueen❄#7887: It is not bad at all. Safety is important, and if you feel they would not support you, then whatever you decide is perfectly ok. You are valid either way❤️
