[2021-04-14 15:34:28] (820071609683148801) Lilac_cat#5631: Lately I have been very confused about my sexuality and I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice. Recently I have been seeing girls in a new way and that really confused me. I still mostly like boys but im not sure why sometimes I look at girls differently now. Can anyone help me?

[2021-04-14 15:36:05] (820071609683148801) Lilac_cat#5631: thats what I have been thinking too but im so confused and im also new to all of this

[2021-04-14 15:39:33] (799410612333182996) TheFrostQueen❄#7887: It’s a very personal, sensitive subject, even if you decide not to tell them, you are still valid. It is scary, and it is hard to navigate those feelings...you will always have support here

[2021-04-14 15:45:17] (799410612333182996) TheFrostQueen❄#7887: It is not bad at all. Safety is important, and if you feel they would not support you, then whatever you decide is perfectly ok. You are valid either way❤️
[2021-04-14 15:45:31] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Definitely not

[2021-04-15 14:40:50] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I mean, maybe try introducing other people or media who are lgbtq+ to her and see how she reacts to that? But honestly, it's up to you if you want to come out. You don't have to (especially if you don't feel safe) and you shouldn't feel pressured to do so.
[2021-04-15 18:36:02] (714866901741862973) Byama#3003: Hey y’all I haven’t come out to a few of my friends yet so I wanted to ask how I possibly could? If anyone has any funny bisexual coming out things to say or whatever I’d love to hear them!!

[2021-04-16 20:37:51] (775066414242463808) Pigeon Queen#3514: I first tought I was bi but i was attracted like 98% girls and 2% guys maybe.. Then I tought Lesbian was for me, but non biney people...I have a big preference for girls but I don't want to reject someone because of their gender !
[2021-04-16 20:39:17] (758246297060376588) CauliflowerCerberus#8503: You could always go with the label queer
[2021-04-16 20:39:54] (758246297060376588) CauliflowerCerberus#8503: It’s more general and isn’t much of a box but still a label

[2021-04-16 20:41:36] (775066414242463808) Pigeon Queen#3514: I feel like I need something specific.. To feel part of something.. Like if I go to pride, what flag could I have? The rainbow one is too vague

Maybe there is no box for me?
[2021-04-16 20:44:33] (758246297060376588) CauliflowerCerberus#8503: There is a queer flag. But hey you know you don’t have follow the strict definition of labels. You could pick one that sounds right but still love whoever you want
[2021-04-16 20:44:51] (758246297060376588) CauliflowerCerberus#8503: You aren’t straight you already are in a community
[2021-04-16 20:45:37] (758246297060376588) CauliflowerCerberus#8503: And there doesn’t have to be a box for you

[2021-04-16 20:48:15] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Just to say you can be bi and have preferences to genders that doesn’t invalidate your sexuality I’m bisexual but I’m more into females than males (but I don’t particularly care for genders either way but yeah)
[2021-04-16 20:48:18] (437273191908376576) ReeyA#7915: exactly, and i also believe that sexuality is a spectrum and it can change
[2021-04-16 20:49:44] (775066414242463808) Pigeon Queen#3514: The only thing I'm sure of, is that girls give me butterflies 🥰

[2021-04-16 21:11:29] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: That's really hard alot of the time you just kinda know your not straight so you go looking for lables and one just seems right or closer to right then straight... Its really hard to figure out and different for all poeple
[2021-04-16 21:12:37] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: some poeple get to that point with experiance and others just kinda know, just know there is no right or wrong way to figure this out and however you figure it out is how it happens

I’m also aromantic which also explained why I didn’t know what romance was or never felt it.
[2021-04-16 21:20:15] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: Yah I feel that Im kind ace and aro fluid (like the way I like someone kinda changes)

[2021-04-16 21:43:53] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: some poeple do feel a little romantic attraction to that person but not alot

[2021-04-17 00:16:41] (654503227051474977) ghostproductions#4913: No because nobody should hate anyone or assume anything about anyone based on something they can’t control
[2021-04-17 00:16:56] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Yeah, doesn't make sense. We're not competing for the same resources.
[2021-04-17 00:18:22] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Look up the 'gay uncle' theory. Homosexuality has advantages, specifically because homosexual people are competing for different resources.

[2021-04-17 18:54:57] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: how can you be trans and non binary at the same time? i have a trans friend and he indentifies as trans non binary but im confused
[2021-04-17 18:55:23] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: isnt the whole point of being trans is switching from one gender to the other?
[2021-04-17 18:56:46] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: he said he doesnt understand it himself
[2021-04-17 18:57:06] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: a lot of trans people are in the gender binary but being trans basically just means identifying with a gender other than the one assigned to you at birth. the white flag on the trans flag stands for nonbinary gender identites and trans is generally an umbrella term for anything not cis
[2021-04-17 18:57:50] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: oh so trans doesnt only mean ftm or mtf?
[2021-04-17 18:58:10] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: nope! anyone who isn't cis can use the term trans
[2021-04-17 18:58:17] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: really? i see
[2021-04-17 18:58:24] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: huh
[2021-04-17 18:58:27] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: interesting
[2021-04-17 18:59:13] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: what about like xenogenders and stuff like that
[2021-04-17 18:59:16] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: is that trans too?
[2021-04-17 18:59:21] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: i dont understand those at all
[2021-04-17 18:59:52] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: it's honestly best to just ask people what terms they use for themselves
[2021-04-17 19:00:02] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: ah alright
[2021-04-17 19:00:21] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: its just hard for me to grasp
[2021-04-17 19:00:24] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: especially about xenogenders since those can be very specific to the person
[2021-04-17 19:00:51] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: its hard for me to grasp because for me theres only man and woman
[2021-04-17 19:01:05] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: idk its just how ive been brought up
[2021-04-17 19:01:31] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: so this whole spectrum thing is new to me

[2021-04-17 19:02:48] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: it's valid not to understand everything and nobody blames you for not understanding things immediately, however please refrain from saying that there are only men and women because it isn't true and very hurtful for people who don't fit into the gender binary
[2021-04-17 19:03:11] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: i dont mean to hurt anyonr
[2021-04-17 19:03:15] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: im just trying to understand

[2021-04-17 19:04:40] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: it’s important to separate the fact that gender is not sex, gender is how you want to be perceived/how you want to present!
[2021-04-17 19:04:48] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: huh okay
[2021-04-17 19:04:51] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: interesting
[2021-04-17 19:05:08] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: so sex is whats on the birth certificate and gender can be whatever?
[2021-04-17 19:05:58] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: basically yes, sex is the gender assigned to you at birth and gender is what you identify as and the two often overlap but not always
[2021-04-17 19:06:15] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: hm alright
[2021-04-17 19:08:20] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: thats new to me
[2021-04-17 19:10:12] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: it's new for a lot of people and nobody would blame you for not understanding something right off the bat! it's not the easiest thing to understand, the key is just to be understanding and respectful ^^
[2021-04-17 19:10:26] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: yeah im trying!

[2021-04-17 19:10:45] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: what ive always known
[2021-04-17 19:12:11] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: ive always been taught how like women have ||vaginas|| and men ||penises|| right? but i grew up in egypt so maybe thats why

[2021-04-18 02:47:06] (428653342999183370) keykey#0420: transgender's dictionary definition is: *"denoting or relating to a person whose sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond with their birth sex."* (from google) 

since nonbinary people do not always 100% of the time identify as their assigned sex at birth, nb people are inherently trans (though some nb people choose not to claim a trans identity and thats valid too!)

additionally the creator of the transgender flag has said the white stripe is for "those who are intersex, transitioning or consider themselves having a neutral or undefined gender." (neutral/undefined being non binary!) (i believe someone else already stated his oops)

non binary is also a spectrum– an umbrella term, as there's many ways to be non binary! some people just use non binary as an identity itself, though some also use more distinct descriptors like genderqueer, agender, demigender, genderfluid, etc!

[2021-04-20 00:54:41] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i mean i already use other sets of pronouns
[2021-04-20 00:54:48] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: per example my name
[2021-04-20 00:55:05] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i just can't tell if i hate she/her because i always get called them

[2021-04-20 00:59:43] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: some days i feel they/she or they/them or they/he

[2021-04-20 01:08:37] (737699384741068801) Gayming Deer#3446: Do I have to be a certain gender to use certain pronouns? I go bye she/they and everyone says I have to be demigirl or smt...
[2021-04-20 01:09:03] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: No, pronouns don’t necessarily equate to gender
[2021-04-20 01:09:15] (444537905919164428) Scythe#9417: pronouns often follow gender, but not always
[2021-04-20 01:09:47] (737699384741068801) Gayming Deer#3446: Okay. Thanks, I just don't like she/her as my pronouns anymore
[2021-04-20 01:14:46] (825392044779503636) DinoDev#1621: Can someone explain demi-girl and demi-boy for me real quick?
[2021-04-20 01:14:56] (825392044779503636) DinoDev#1621: I used to know but i forgot the defenition

[2021-04-20 01:17:18] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: demi-girl is someone who partially but not fully identifies as a woman
demi-boy is someone who partially but not fully identifies as a male
[2021-04-20 01:17:39] (825392044779503636) DinoDev#1621: Alrighty

[2021-04-20 01:17:46] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: no problem
[2021-04-20 01:40:13] (825392044779503636) DinoDev#1621: Any way to be a femboy without the title “femboy”, femboy sounds too sexual in my opinion and most people would view it sexually.
[2021-04-20 01:40:53] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: honestly that
[2021-04-20 01:42:02] (825392044779503636) DinoDev#1621: yep

[2021-04-20 17:06:03] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: hm... why do I feel as if I've forgotten how what my gender identity is? It's as if I intellectually know what I identify as, but it doesn't really seem to matter to me anymore at this moment. ?!?!
[2021-04-20 17:06:58] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I feel like it's partially because I told myself that it didn't matter too much but why did it JUST click? 😐

[2021-04-21 11:52:00] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: If you look in <#827957348873928744> it is in there
[2021-04-21 11:53:51] (437273191908376576) ReeyA#7915: but what is difference between pan and bi
[2021-04-21 12:00:04] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: it depends on the specifics for people, but pansexuality is like on the bi spectrum. Bi means two or more, but pan is more specific in that attraction is regardless of gender (even if preferences are present)
[2021-04-21 12:03:30] (437273191908376576) ReeyA#7915: i guess im pan lol

[2021-04-22 00:59:57] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: For a while I struggled accepting myself and honestly I'm still not sure what label fits me but tbh Idc abt that but I realized it doesnt matter. I know who I am and I like how I express my identity and that's all that matters
[2021-04-22 02:51:11] (733845646276165653) Linking_Dev#8658: Is it bad I don't support the LGBTQ+ community? I don't have anything against individual people and would never discriminate against anyone, I'm just sick and tired of all the constant LGBTQ propaganda getting shoved down my throat (pride month, LGBTQ parades, etc.).

I'm asking because I keep seeing LGBT people saying "just let us live our lives in peace" while going out of their way to promote their ideas and beliefs to everyone and then some, but when I speak up about it suddenly I'm a ||"homophobic, transphobic racist piece of garbage that should die in a hole"|| (and yes i've been called that before BY members of the lgbt community) just because I'm kind of tired of constantly seeing it everywhere, (it's like when slime was a huge trend on youtube, it was cool for the first month or two, then it was just annoying seeing it on the front page over and over again.)

Like keep in mind I would even bring this up if it wasn't for the extreme toxicity I've gotten, is this actually how people of the community think & feel? If so that's absolutely disgusting if they think that treating people like this is okay.
[2021-04-22 02:52:36] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: [I uhh.. I'm going to leave answering that up to someone else.]

[2021-04-22 02:53:55] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: then i don't think you should be having an opinion on how people like to express themselves
[2021-04-22 02:54:51] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i would also like you to explain why you have all the pronoun roles then

[2021-04-22 02:55:17] (696517486983643196) Okuajub#0416: not to be contrarian, but cis people can have multiple pronoun sets, too.
[2021-04-22 02:55:44] (430621608877490186) Rodger#0283: Yes I’m an example of that
[2021-04-22 02:55:50] (696517486983643196) Okuajub#0416: pronouns do not equal gender and that goes for cis people as well.
[2021-04-22 02:57:24] (430621608877490186) Rodger#0283: I don’t really have a preference on gender but I just like them/they

[2021-04-22 02:59:46] (458408109027753986) Amanda (she/her)#2715: Since linkin dev said the weren’t lgbt
[2021-04-22 03:00:43] (733845646276165653) Linking_Dev#8658: Wdym I don't get an opinion? I don't care how people express themselves whatsoever, people can do whatever the heck they want and I couldn't care less, all I was asking was if I didn't support the "community" (I.E the fundamental ideas behind them), but **did** support individual people, (like for example, I run a small business and would never discriminate on one of my employees because they're LGBT) if that actually made me homophobic/transphobic??
[2021-04-22 03:00:45] (430621608877490186) Rodger#0283: Yeah if you identify as different pronouns then your assigned gender your apart of the lgbt

[2021-04-22 03:02:38] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i'm more confused why you were searching for an lgbt server if you don't like "the agenda being shoved down your throat"

I know they won't be happy, but i have been dealing with a lot of depressive episodes because i am lying to them so often so i need to do it for myself. Does anyone have any ideas of how i should word what i say to them? (i am a young bisexual female)

[2021-04-22 05:10:00] (85147068900847616) B3Y0ND#7326: I’m straight so I’m not the greatest with advice on these topics. I know it’s difficult though. But my sister in law had to do the same thing to her family. I think it shouldn’t matter what they think because it’s your life. If they don’t accept it, it’s their loss because at the end of the day, you’re still a person who is amazing in their own ways. If they miss out on that, then it’s their loss. Everyone is perfect, no matter who you are. It won’t be easy if you have a family who believes that way, but they can choose to accept it, because at the end of they day, you’re still a part of their family, so they have to live with it. If they don’t take it well, they lose. Because then they don’t get what they want. Families like that try to force people into being how they want them to be. I grew up with ||racist and homophobic|| parents who tried to mold me into a carbon copy of themselves. I decided one day that I had enough of it so I made my own decisions and they have to live with the fact that I’m not the way that they imagined me to be. Be proud of who you are. As long as you love yourself for who you are, then it doesn’t matter what other people think. 💛

Don’t be scared to be yourself because of your family.

[2021-04-24 01:19:17] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: Yep
[2021-04-24 01:21:02] (332696293111758848) JuJuGagEuphoric#8433: Okay so I've only ever dated trans guys, the reason being is because like I just get along pretty well with them and tend to be attracted to them. The reason being is that I'm attracted to people that I want to look like. Like "You look really handsome, I want to look like you" type of thing. Does this make me a chaser? I respect trans people as I am one and don't objectify them, just sometimes I feel bad because I've only ever felt a pull towards them mostly
[2021-04-24 01:22:58] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: I don’t think so it is just a preference which is allowed

[2021-04-24 01:27:32] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: it's the same when some people are more drawn to cis people, as long as it doesn't become a thing of ew trans people or I'd never look at a trans person then its fine
[2021-04-24 05:37:44] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: Yeah, and usually if you're similar, you get along better, especially if they know what you're boing through body-wise and in a way, mentally.
