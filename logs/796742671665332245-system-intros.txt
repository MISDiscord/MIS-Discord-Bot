[2021-04-12 05:06:21] (829851298811215902) Us#6468: Hi, we're The Unit, our tag is TU
There's 7(?) of us but only four of us will be here.
We collectively use they/them but have our preferences depending on who is fronting
We're often co-fronting or somewhat 'blurred' (for lack of a better word) between people, but R is the one you're likely to see the most
We're always open to DMs (we just ask that you ask first). We're figuring this out as we go and eager to meet others like us.
