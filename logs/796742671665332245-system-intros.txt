[2021-04-12 05:06:21] (829851298811215902) Us#6468: Hi, we're The Unit, our tag is TU
There's 7(?) of us but only four of us will be here.
We collectively use they/them but have our preferences depending on who is fronting
We're often co-fronting or somewhat 'blurred' (for lack of a better word) between people, but R is the one you're likely to see the most
We're always open to DMs (we just ask that you ask first). We're figuring this out as we go and eager to meet others like us.

Typically many of us will use they/them pronouns with no trouble as often it is the easiest way to be addressed by people, but many of use also use he/him or just all pronouns. We are currently a system of 15, that is what we know about at least. The body is a minor, as are many of the alters, and each person is different in their own way. We have alters who are not allowed online such as anybody under thirteen and a couple others. We have many fictives that are usually more than happy to answer questions about their origin worlds and for the most part we are all very nice! 
A List of our members:
Silus -the host- he/they
Astrid -the main co-host and caretaker- they/them
Astro -Gatekeeper- they/them
Karsyn -perpetrator, does not front often unless it is forced- He/Him
Arius -Main- All pronouns
Riveren -Protector- They/Them
Atlas -Protector- He/They
Niko -Protector- He/Him
Archer -Persecutor- He/Him
Ashton -non-role holder but does front often- He/Him
Nesrin -non-role holder- She/Her
Griffin -non-role holder- They/He
Toby -Fictive- He/Him

**Currently these are all the members of the Daybreakers system that have either consented or are able to be listed**
