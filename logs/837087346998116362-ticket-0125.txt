[2021-04-28 22:07:02] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: Hey bloby boi, how can I help?
[2021-04-28 22:07:17] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: Ive been trying to help animals but im stuggling to do so and.
[2021-04-28 22:08:05] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: i did somthing stupid trying to find a happy way to be positve around my dog because i dont want to be sad around her cuz she feels the energy
[2021-04-28 22:08:22] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: i found a dog video that had a really sad ending
[2021-04-28 22:08:33] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: its dumb but i cant stop thinking about it
[2021-04-28 22:08:49] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: i also watched a bird get hit by a truck.
[2021-04-28 22:09:02] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: Ueah
[2021-04-28 22:09:06] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: thats all.
[2021-04-28 22:09:19] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: Oof, that's all really upsetting
[2021-04-28 22:09:49] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: You were worried about your dog?
[2021-04-28 22:10:20] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: Yeah that too
[2021-04-28 22:11:30] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: Here, I'm a little confused on this. Is this a goal that you set for yourself, to help out animals? And you were watching videos to help you do that?
[2021-04-28 22:12:23] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: No i was watching a video cuz i was sad and i wanted not to have that energy around pearl cuz she can feel energy like that
[2021-04-28 22:12:47] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: thats why when we yell they know they did somthing wrong for example
[2021-04-28 22:13:18] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: Oh, gotcha, I understand now!
[2021-04-28 22:13:26] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: yeah
[2021-04-28 22:13:43] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: Is the video the thing that's bothering you right now? Or is it more of the sad feelings you mentioned?
[2021-04-28 22:14:37] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: Thats her
[2021-04-28 22:14:38] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: Shes really sweet and she loves us so i wanna keep her safe thats why the vid made me sad
[2021-04-28 22:15:23] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: Awwwww, she's so cute! She looks a bit like my parents dog actually, is she a poodle?
[2021-04-28 22:15:31] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: Maltipoo
[2021-04-28 22:15:43] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: Maltese and poodle
[2021-04-28 22:16:04] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: you can imagine the hair problem if she’s related to both of those dogs lol
[2021-04-28 22:17:27] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: I acctualy coped in a weird but really helpful way
[2021-04-28 22:17:56] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: i made an alt ending on what happend after the video ended
[2021-04-28 22:18:11] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: but again talking about it rn really is helping
[2021-04-28 22:18:47] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: Would you like to tell me about the alt ending then? I could always use an uplifting animal story!
[2021-04-28 22:20:13] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: So in the video of the dog it’s a Bandan but what I did is after it was a Bandan for months it was found by someone right where the dog would normally live which was under a tree and he took care of it and of course he fed it and loved it and the other guy got arrested because of abandoning a Pet which is illegal and cruel and the dog lived happliy ever after
[2021-04-28 22:20:34] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: i used voice to text so there are typos
[2021-04-28 22:21:09] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: No worries, I understand the meaning
[2021-04-28 22:21:27] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: That's a sweet resolution! And to be fair, it ends up like that for a lot of dogs
[2021-04-28 22:21:38] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: Really.
[2021-04-28 22:21:44] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: oh
[2021-04-28 22:22:00] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: well thats why im trying to help them :)
[2021-04-28 22:22:34] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: Yeah, lots of people work in the animal care industry and they're genuinely very passionate and caring. Do you want to go into that too?
[2021-04-28 22:22:55] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: Btw the dog video was animated but it still hurt even tho it wasent real
[2021-04-28 22:22:59] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: and yes
[2021-04-28 22:23:09] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: ive always had a thing for animals!
[2021-04-28 22:23:20] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: (not snakes)
[2021-04-28 22:23:26] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: well most snakes
[2021-04-28 22:23:28] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: heh
[2021-04-28 22:24:14] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: Well, in some ways, animated is even better because the story you made is just as real! Hopefully you'll be able to help animals just like that in the future
[2021-04-28 22:24:37] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: Do you have a favorite type of animal to work with?
[2021-04-28 22:24:46] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: Ive always wanted too
[2021-04-28 22:24:53] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: i like all animals
[2021-04-28 22:25:00] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: so hard to say
[2021-04-28 22:25:10] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: but suprisingly i really love pigs
[2021-04-28 22:25:15] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: guess why
[2021-04-28 22:25:37] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: Ok nvm its impossible to guess
[2021-04-28 22:25:42] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: minecraft.
[2021-04-28 22:26:00] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: yeah i like pigs becuase of that and lots of animals i like
[2021-04-28 22:26:23] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: so not only raising awareness for them will help but i want to be a vet also!
[2021-04-28 22:27:01] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: Ooooo, pigs are such sweethearts! And that's impressive, being a vet is hard work but also really rewarding

[2021-04-28 22:29:27] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: Of course! Would you like me to close out the ticket then?
[2021-04-28 22:29:41] (812811776110231614) Tinylee63#2664: that would be fine!
