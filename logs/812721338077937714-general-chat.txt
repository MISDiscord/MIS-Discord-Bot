[2021-04-21 10:53:40] (279266238595858432) Squirry (team parzu)#2459: struggling a bit. Was really hyper and euphoric for the past few days now I'm kinda drained and sad
[2021-04-21 14:29:55] (666125620236910614) Morrow#7748: Honestly, why the fuck do I even bother to try and be friends with my ex best friend again? Every time I try and talk to her she jumps from one subject to the next and I can't get an answer out of her. All she fucking talks about is her grades and how she's so fucking smart. Like who cares? Grades don't matter in the real world. Work ethic and effort do. She should know that but apparently she's been fired from jobs, so I guess she doesn't. Why do I even bother trying to become friends with her again? All she's gonna do is do the same old shit. Just knock me down...
[2021-04-21 14:44:25] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: As a person who’s very focused on grades I can tell you my experience: she sounds insecure. Usually, when that type of person brags about it is bc she isn’t doing anything actually productive or feels like a failure, so she brags about that stuff to make herself feel better and not so much like a failure.
[2021-04-21 14:59:11] (666125620236910614) Morrow#7748:
