[2021-04-21 14:29:55] (666125620236910614) Morrow#7748: Honestly, why the fuck do I even bother to try and be friends with my ex best friend again? Every time I try and talk to her she jumps from one subject to the next and I can't get an answer out of her. All she fucking talks about is her grades and how she's so fucking smart. Like who cares? Grades don't matter in the real world. Work ethic and effort do. She should know that but apparently she's been fired from jobs, so I guess she doesn't. Why do I even bother trying to become friends with her again? All she's gonna do is do the same old shit. Just knock me down...
[2021-04-21 14:44:25] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: As a person who’s very focused on grades I can tell you my experience: she sounds insecure. Usually, when that type of person brags about it is bc she isn’t doing anything actually productive or feels like a failure, so she brags about that stuff to make herself feel better and not so much like a failure.

[2021-04-26 17:05:01] (666125620236910614) Morrow#7748: I'm sorry, but why is my cousin so fucking dumb?
[2021-04-26 17:06:22] (666125620236910614) Morrow#7748: He says that he wants to be there for me, yet when I talk to him about some of my problems all he says is "I'm sorry" or "That sucks". Like that makes me feel any better. I'm *trying* to teach him how to be empethetic ( he doesn't even know what that means) and it's not going so well
[2021-04-26 18:05:21] (279266238595858432) Squirry (team parzu)#2459: <@!666125620236910614> I gave up hoping on family for help because they just don't get mental illness. I'm sorry yours are the same
[2021-04-26 18:06:42] (666125620236910614) Morrow#7748: Haha he's just so dumb it's hilarious. I try to be nice to him but sometimes its frusterating because he doesn't take my advice at all. He's 24-25 and he hasn't worked a day in his life. He doesn't have a resume, and he just plays video games all day long
[2021-04-26 18:07:59] (279266238595858432) Squirry (team parzu)#2459: oof yeah that sounds irritating. I want to get a job once my ||psychosis|| gets better

[2021-04-26 18:22:56] (771298856004223007) Marian_#7941: that sounds like he has mental health problems of his own.
[2021-04-26 18:23:30] (666125620236910614) Morrow#7748: No, he's just really really austic and he won't admit that there's somethign wrong with him
[2021-04-26 18:23:57] (771298856004223007) Marian_#7941: well, there you go
[2021-04-26 18:25:26] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: There’s nothing wrong with him, being autistic doesn’t mean a person is “broken”, etc...but I get your frustration.

[2021-04-29 04:49:01] (722510980785111092) Trish#2056: It’s all just for a few sentences on a resume that cost thousands to even put on your resume. And years. And debt. Just to get a good job. Sometimes the job isn’t even that good at first. Like I have to do it but also...??? What the hell

[2021-04-29 17:34:44] (666125620236910614) Morrow#7748: Dudeeeee college sucks. That's why I'm not  continuing my 4 year degree
[2021-04-29 18:23:44] (279266238595858432) Squirry (team parzu)#2459: I'm mixed about college. There's days I'm somewhat clearheaded and I realize that I could do college, but 90% of the time I'm either lazy as heck or my brain shuts down and stops working and everything goes badly.
[2021-04-29 18:45:08] (666125620236910614) Morrow#7748: College is a joke. Some of them don't even prepare you for the real world
[2021-04-29 18:46:07] (279266238595858432) Squirry (team parzu)#2459: <@!666125620236910614> I just want my degree since it's been 4 years but to do that I'll need more ||meds|| and that scares me
[2021-04-29 18:49:54] (666125620236910614) Morrow#7748: oh no!
[2021-04-29 23:17:22] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: still on the topic of college, my english professor sucks
[2021-04-29 23:18:13] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: I'm going into math but I still have to take a fricking english class with stuff I learned in highschool and this man I swear I've learned nothing from this class that's way too expensive for me to not learn anything

[2021-04-30 12:05:40] (279266238595858432) Squirry (team parzu)#2459: I'm wondering if I should lock up my translating books for good and devote myself fully to uni, focus issues and all
