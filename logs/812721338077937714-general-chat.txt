[2021-04-11 16:58:37] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: does anyone know any good journals/blogs/websites to get paid to write an article about mental health and/or being lgbtq
[2021-04-11 16:59:05] (338358571484053506) Pharaoh_Atemu#0388: I've found some, but a one requires the writer to be 21+ and some require like other published works which I don't have yet

[2021-04-11 17:04:25] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Your best bet is to start a blog, promote yourself and your writing, and then turn that into a paid gig.

[2021-04-13 14:36:38] (540371757769424921) Betsy#9202: one thing that people don't realize is that it has to be a *valid* ID at least in my state, so people sometimes try to give me an expired ID and I have to refuse the sale even though it says they're old enough
[2021-04-13 14:37:12] (540371757769424921) Betsy#9202: they get a little pissy sometimes and i just tell them to take it up with the state

[2021-04-13 14:52:14] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We are over 30 and we get ID'd all the time. When we were in our 20's people thought we were still in high school.
[2021-04-13 18:05:21] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: i’m 18, and i’ve been mistaken for very legal for years. i get asked if my siblings are my kids 😅
[2021-04-14 16:33:53] (666125620236910614) Morrow#7748: Dude, I get that. People think I'm in high school when I'm actually 22 and in college
[2021-04-14 16:34:23] (666125620236910614) Morrow#7748: I know that this is a stupid question, but how do you do the black censor bar?
[2021-04-14 16:34:46] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: || on either side of the text you want to censor
