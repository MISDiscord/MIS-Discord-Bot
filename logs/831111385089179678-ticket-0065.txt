[2021-04-12 11:04:43] (95164972807487488) squírrel#2475: Hi <@!805758896773398538> , sorry for the delay. What's on your mind?
[2021-04-12 11:05:08] (805758896773398538) pumpkin (they/them)#1231: i'm feeling very sad and i see no other way than to s/h again
[2021-04-12 11:05:46] (95164972807487488) squírrel#2475: okay, is anything in particular making you feel sad at the moment?
[2021-04-12 11:06:19] (805758896773398538) pumpkin (they/them)#1231: just seeing other ppl around me being happy and together with others
[2021-04-12 11:07:39] (95164972807487488) squírrel#2475: I can relate to that, it can seem rather depressing when everyone else seems to be having a better time. Generally it's best to try and avoid comparing your life to someone else's, although I  get that can be hard to do sometimes
[2021-04-12 11:09:07] (95164972807487488) squírrel#2475: I'd generally recommend trying to focus on something else other than what other people are doing. Your life isn't any less meaningful than anyone else's
[2021-04-12 11:11:17] (805758896773398538) pumpkin (they/them)#1231: it does feel like that
[2021-04-12 11:11:27] (805758896773398538) pumpkin (they/them)#1231: i wonder why i can't be special
[2021-04-12 11:12:09] (95164972807487488) squírrel#2475: Why do you think you're not special? What makes you think others are?
[2021-04-12 11:41:12] (95164972807487488) squírrel#2475: Hey <@!805758896773398538> , it's been a bit since your last message, just wanted to check in if you're doing okay?
[2021-04-12 11:45:17] (805758896773398538) pumpkin (they/them)#1231: sorry i had to do something
[2021-04-12 11:45:55] (95164972807487488) squírrel#2475: no worries, that's absolutely fine
[2021-04-12 11:45:57] (805758896773398538) pumpkin (they/them)#1231: other ppl are great they're cute kind and they also almost always have someone a friend or a relationship and i'm not like that
[2021-04-12 11:48:54] (95164972807487488) squírrel#2475: That's okay, everyone is different and that makes us all special
[2021-04-12 11:49:28] (95164972807487488) squírrel#2475: Wouldn't you say that if you were exactly like someone that you describe, then it would no longer be special since now two people share the same trait?
[2021-04-12 11:50:45] (805758896773398538) pumpkin (they/them)#1231: you're right
[2021-04-12 11:50:54] (805758896773398538) pumpkin (they/them)#1231: it wouldn;t make it special anymore
[2021-04-12 11:52:01] (95164972807487488) squírrel#2475: so by the same logic that makes you special, just the way you are, what do you think?
[2021-04-12 11:57:24] (805758896773398538) pumpkin (they/them)#1231: it might be true but it doesn't feel like that
[2021-04-12 12:00:16] (95164972807487488) squírrel#2475: yeah, I can relate to that. It rarely feels like we're special, normally only when we take a few steps back and look at thing from a distance can we sometimes realise what's going. What normally cheers you up a little when you're feeling sad?
[2021-04-12 12:05:33] (805758896773398538) pumpkin (they/them)#1231: listening music i think
[2021-04-12 12:06:58] (95164972807487488) squírrel#2475: Have you tried just getting comfortable and listening to some music and try and focus more on the music than your thoughts?
[2021-04-12 12:08:31] (805758896773398538) pumpkin (they/them)#1231: i suppose i could try doing that
[2021-04-12 12:12:35] (95164972807487488) squírrel#2475: give that a go and see if it can help you get in a better space
[2021-04-12 14:11:04] (805758896773398538) pumpkin (they/them)#1231: thank you
