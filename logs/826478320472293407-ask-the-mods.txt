[2021-04-25 23:25:33] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: plural people refer to systems. usually they’re diagnosed with a dissociative disordered. They’re people who share one body. So one body may have lots of people inside of it, they switch to who’s fronting and in control of the body, and plural kit allows them to show us their own personality and names and likes and dislikes

Idea for the bot
would you be able to add something to the bot that adds text to images?
so you could type (!batbee "I love you") and it would show this with the text under it
it probably won't work for every image though, so they might need to be add manually
