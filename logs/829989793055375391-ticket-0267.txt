[2021-04-09 08:03:21] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: I got muted but I feel it was a bit unfairly...
[2021-04-09 08:04:12] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: I don't know what exactly I said that was nsfw or should have been censored, I apologize if I did so but I'm not sure which ones it was and it was an accident
[2021-04-09 08:04:34] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: I'm scrolling up through the chat to see any
[2021-04-09 08:05:16] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: and when it was mentioned by Jupiter I did apologize and stop immediately/deleted any messages that he said were supposed to be censored and read through the list and I thought I got things that were supposed to be censored
[2021-04-09 08:05:56] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: hi, i deleted everything that was not censored and inappropriate from the channel which is probably why you can't see it.
[2021-04-09 08:06:12] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: oh
[2021-04-09 08:06:46] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: well some of my concern is if I don't know what I said or did wrong while thinking it was okay, it's just going to repeat again and I'd rather not mess up twice
[2021-04-09 08:07:23] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: however, everyone in that conversation talked about ||smoking|| without censoring it which is a two strike rule. as well as there were comments made about ||stripping|| which is an nsfw topic that should not be discussed in non nsfw channels.
[2021-04-09 08:09:21] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: oh, I do remember those two. I forgot ||smoking|| was censoring but I do remember that happening. I'm sorry about the ||stripping|| one. I did scroll through and find a missing comment of mine. I didn't know if it was too heavy to be censored or not when i sent it
[2021-04-09 08:10:29] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: if you have an issue with how i choose to dealt with the situation, you're free to message either of the senior moderators about your concerns. if you have any more questions for me, you're free to ask.
[2021-04-09 08:12:54] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: no more questions thanks
[2021-04-09 08:13:34] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: is it alright if i close the ticket now?
[2021-04-09 08:15:05] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: mhm
[2021-04-09 08:15:20] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: alright, thank you
