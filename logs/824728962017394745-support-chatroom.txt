[2021-04-14 03:56:31] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: hey <@!806892800301727775> please refrain from opening already closed tickets.
[2021-04-14 03:56:54] (806892800301727775) P🌱#3042: They’d closed it themselves 4 minutes after opening it as they didn’t get an immediate response
[2021-04-14 03:57:45] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: I'm aware, however, that happens a lot. If they close the ticket then they close the ticket.
[2021-04-14 03:58:38] (806892800301727775) P🌱#3042: I see, noted. Apologies
[2021-04-14 04:01:05] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: It's alright. The introduction of the ticket mentions that a private support member will be with them as soon as possible however we're not always free to attend to a ticket right when it opens. We expect that the users respect that knowledge and waiting till someone arrives. Of course if someone doesn't arrive in less than 2 hours, they're free to ping again. However, as said before, we can't do anything if they close the ticket out of their own will.
