[2021-04-14 03:56:54] (806892800301727775) P🌱#3042: They’d closed it themselves 4 minutes after opening it as they didn’t get an immediate response
[2021-04-14 03:57:45] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: I'm aware, however, that happens a lot. If they close the ticket then they close the ticket.
[2021-04-14 03:58:38] (806892800301727775) P🌱#3042: I see, noted. Apologies
[2021-04-14 04:01:05] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: It's alright. The introduction of the ticket mentions that a private support member will be with them as soon as possible however we're not always free to attend to a ticket right when it opens. We expect that the users respect that knowledge and waiting till someone arrives. Of course if someone doesn't arrive in less than 2 hours, they're free to ping again. However, as said before, we can't do anything if they close the ticket out of their own will.

I'm not sure if I should suggest they see a professional about alters/fictives. I think therapy is helpful in general! But would it appear wrong for me to say that they should see someone about i? For example, if someone said they thought they had depression or anxiety etc., I would recommend they see someone about it but I don't know if this is different. Is it something to be treated, as a symptom of a mental illness or is it a lifestyle choice? I've seen it be both but as someone with not a lot of experience on it, I'd like another perspective
[2021-04-26 19:26:00] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: Being a system is the result of a disorder. It’s useful to see a therapist regardless, however there’s nothing wrong with having alters and therapy isn’t going to change the fact that someone is part of a system. It can help them cope however.
