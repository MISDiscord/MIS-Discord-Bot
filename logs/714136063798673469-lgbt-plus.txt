I’d just be careful with your choice of words saying things like  ||“the gay”||. Is it possible you can edit your post and just say something like “idk if I’m gay/bi etc.?” Just to be safe for other members?:) thanks

[2021-04-12 17:21:01] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We didn't come out to our parents until we were 27 and already had children. It was quite the shocker to them.

it isn’t a matter of is it “fair” to the parents, it’s a matter of if the person is safe. /lh

[2021-04-15 05:57:22] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: it's kinda like demisexual but more specific, if I fall in love with a woman I'm only sexually attracted to a woman
[2021-04-15 05:57:36] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: it gets pretty specific for me, if I fall in love with a black trans woman, that's the only enticing thing

[2021-04-15 06:08:39] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: I said I was demisexual for years, lovesexual is just more specific
[2021-04-15 06:09:17] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: demisexual as far as I understand is when you fall in love you go from asexual to sexually attracted to something, so like maybe bisexual or just to men, so demihomosexual or demipansexual
[2021-04-15 06:09:29] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: and lovesexual means it's specifically for the person you are with specifically
[2021-04-15 06:09:36] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: as far as I understand anyways XD

[2021-04-15 06:19:53] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: see the trick to being a productive procrastinator is to procrastinate on things that need to be finished, so if you have homework in 3 subjects, say math, science, history. procrastinate doing math homework by doing science, science by doing history, history by doing math

[2021-04-17 02:33:50] (814215847173685291) Chaotic Hellbender#1263: Is Asexuality a mental illness, because If i have one more fucking person call me a monster or a freak for being asexual, I have a number fro a therapy line to help fix it that Im loosing fear to use
[2021-04-17 02:34:24] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: no it isn’t a mental illness. i’m sorry you’re being told that.
[2021-04-17 02:34:44] (799410612333182996) TheFrostQueen❄#7887: Asexuality is not a mental illness at all. It is valid. I’m sorry people are telling you that
[2021-04-17 02:39:33] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: You can't 'fix' a person's sexuality. They are born with it. Some people discover more about themselves as their life goes on and this gives the appearance of sexuality changing, but there is a good argument to support the idea that it was always the way a person experiences it in the present.
[2021-04-17 02:43:09] (814215847173685291) Chaotic Hellbender#1263: How can I be asexual though if it isn't an illness
[2021-04-17 02:43:27] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: What is your definition of illness?
[2021-04-17 02:43:27] (814215847173685291) Chaotic Hellbender#1263: even my doctor said it was probably from my low hormones
[2021-04-17 02:44:35] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: hormones don’t give you attraction. they may affect desire (which is different from attraction) but you can still be attracted to someone.
[2021-04-17 02:45:07] (814215847173685291) Chaotic Hellbender#1263: She said i was probaby identifying as aro/ace because of them
[2021-04-17 02:45:28] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: she sounds aphobic.
[2021-04-17 02:45:43] (814215847173685291) Chaotic Hellbender#1263: But is hse?
[2021-04-17 02:45:51] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: sure sounds like it.
[2021-04-17 02:45:55] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: That is an overly broad view of things, but people do lose their libido for a lot of chemical/hormonal issues.
[2021-04-17 02:46:20] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: that’s the desire i was referring to.
[2021-04-17 02:46:27] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: It is a good thing to explore with your doctor if they think it's a possibility.
[2021-04-17 02:46:30] (814215847173685291) Chaotic Hellbender#1263: there is so much research proving asexuality to just be a medical issues. and everyone should have some attraction to someone.
[2021-04-17 02:46:50] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: there’s nothing wrong with being aro or ace. people thought homosexuality was a mental illness too.
[2021-04-17 02:47:25] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: It isn't bad if you are aromantic. If it is distressing you then there are medical options to explore.
[2021-04-17 02:48:01] (799410612333182996) TheFrostQueen❄#7887: Well, this might be tmi, but I do not have low hormones at all, but I am still asexual. Hormones do not necessarily dictate attraction or the desire to be sexually intimate
[2021-04-17 02:48:05] (814215847173685291) Chaotic Hellbender#1263: at least they have to ability to love others though. Im just this person who cant even have a crush on someone and I hate it.
[2021-04-17 02:48:36] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: you can certainly love others. i’m aromantic and very much in love with my boyfriend.
[2021-04-17 02:49:02] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: that definition of love may feel different for you or be less based on attraction, but it’s still love nonetheless.
[2021-04-17 02:50:06] (799410612333182996) TheFrostQueen❄#7887: I can’t have crushes on anyone either, and it is totally ok and valid. I was confused for a long time, but I eventually allowed myself to realize that not being interested in sexual intimacy, or not having crushes, did not mean I was not capable of love and relationships. You still are if you want it and are comfortable with it
[2021-04-17 02:50:50] (814215847173685291) Chaotic Hellbender#1263: I wnat it, but what high schooler is going to even fucking want a relationship with someone who can't return there emothins
[2021-04-17 02:50:57] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: there’s many other kinds of attraction besides romantic and sexual, and love and/or a healthy relationship doesn’t necessitate attraction.
[2021-04-17 02:51:34] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Yes, the difference between a family bond, a lover bond, and a friendship bond.
[2021-04-17 02:51:45] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: There are others, but those are the significant ones.

[2021-04-17 22:11:39] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: I'm a bit more sympathetic who are ||homophobes|| only because of how their parents bred the hate in them, rather than taking their own common sense. Now if people are faced with truth and are still mean? slap em uwu

[2021-04-19 20:14:27] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: It means you aren't bi/pansexual, but are ok with naked people of the same gender.
[2021-04-19 20:14:32] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It's like..... Being mostly straight.
[2021-04-19 20:14:47] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: But if you found a really really nice person of the same gender, ya wouldn't say no.

[2021-04-19 20:15:58] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Different people take different amounts of time to find someone that they are happy with.

[2021-04-19 20:18:25] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: honestly no one can tell you what you feel but yourself. it’ll take time to figure out who you like, if you really like them, and it’s going to change with time aswell. if you aren’t comfortable with a label yet don’t use one, labels are there for your own personal self, i didn’t use a label for my sexuality for years. 

if you want advice i suggest doing some of your own research as well, looking into the community ^^

take your time, it’s not an easy thing to figure out

[2021-04-22 02:16:48] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: hey, to anyone who is a trans male and likes wearing feminine clothes, no, you're not female or want to be female. You just like that style and you should be able to dress how you want, clothes do not define your gender. Same with trans women who like wearing masc clothes, if you're comfy in it and you're confident in it, who cares? Nonbinary people, no one owes you androgyny, dress how you want. Everyone: dress how you want, clothes do not pick your gender, you know who you are and your clothes will not decide if you're female, male, or under the nonbinary spectrum/genderfluid spectrum. I think all of you need to hear that.
