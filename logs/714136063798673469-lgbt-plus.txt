[2021-04-09 05:24:21] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#7023: Hey I know you probably didn’t mean it like in a negative connotation and it can be taken kinda as like a joking way but also somewhat hurtful to others, it’s just hard to convey tone via texting. I’d just be careful with your choice of words saying things like  ||“the gay”||. Is it possible you can edit your post and just say something like “idk if I’m gay/bi etc.?” Just to be safe for other members?:) thanks
