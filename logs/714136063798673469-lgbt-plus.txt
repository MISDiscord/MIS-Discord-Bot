I’d just be careful with your choice of words saying things like  ||“the gay”||. Is it possible you can edit your post and just say something like “idk if I’m gay/bi etc.?” Just to be safe for other members?:) thanks

[2021-04-12 17:21:01] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We didn't come out to our parents until we were 27 and already had children. It was quite the shocker to them.

it isn’t a matter of is it “fair” to the parents, it’s a matter of if the person is safe. /lh
