[2021-04-17 04:25:23] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: I finally click it... guess it wasnt tht hard after all
[2021-04-17 04:26:20] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: I... I just want to know Who I am
[2021-04-17 04:26:55] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: I o pened this ticket because something happened today and I think I should share
[2021-04-17 04:27:32] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Hey I’m here to listen
[2021-04-17 04:28:32] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: Like.... today I was talking to someone with ||suicidal|| issues...
[2021-04-17 04:29:29] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: Then, I said something tht I over-thought it later, and this person simply just stopped
[2021-04-17 04:29:50] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: I panicked, tried to call 20+ times
[2021-04-17 04:30:42] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: Start guilting myself because I had killed this person, and....
[2021-04-17 04:30:50] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Are you and that person safe and ok now or do you still not know for sure ?
[2021-04-17 04:31:19] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: This person is safe and I am 100%sure
[2021-04-17 04:31:34] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: It was just the battery of the phone in the end
[2021-04-17 04:32:04] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Hey you were probably just scared and nervous and that’s 100% understandable and I’m glad things are ok now
[2021-04-17 04:32:18] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: But... I like, couldn't control myself...
[2021-04-17 04:33:00] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: When you think another human is gonna do something like than especially if you care about that person a lot I’d say the anxiety of it gets the better of anyone in that situation
[2021-04-17 04:34:00] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I think that’s a thing people are incapable of I mean no one should be put in that situation to begin with that’s scary but it’s extremely normal to feel some sort of anxiety and worry and emotions that can get to non stable levels considering the circumstances for sure
[2021-04-17 04:34:12] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: What’s now important is that everyone is safe and ok
[2021-04-17 04:34:36] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: And if you feel your self worked up over it know that that’s a very normal feeling to have for a high stake situation like that
[2021-04-17 04:35:08] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: And Im kinda scared because my psychiatric for 5 years in therapy sections, tried to make me get over something as a child, and in the end I was diagnosed as "normal" and Idk if what Im feeling is "normal", because I always do tht when someone needs help, i panic
[2021-04-17 04:35:41] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: Like, idk I have much more to talk about, lemme just read what you texted me
[2021-04-17 04:37:06] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: I see you... but what if I cared about everyone?
[2021-04-17 04:38:43] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I think you Misread wrong sorry haha I’ll clarify <:guyaGiggle:689539368574386282>  I meant like of course anyone would care about another human in that’s situation it’s natural that you do, and amplified if it’s someone you know or care about if that’s makes sense
[2021-04-17 04:40:18] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: Yes but the problem is tht...( sorry Im not really good at writing down feelings and stuff when Im nervous) I care about everyone at the same level of intensity...
[2021-04-17 04:40:41] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: It's almost like if I loved every one
[2021-04-17 04:41:01] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I mean you can always go to a specialist or doctor that would check for whatever disorder or condition or illness you may feel you have, I’m absolutely no doctor, but I’d say if you think someone is going to ||self harm|| and they just stop answering for 20 mins anyone in that situation would be really really like on edge and nervous and even points of a breakdown. That’s a serious serious thing to handle that everyday people aren’t trained to handle:/
[2021-04-17 04:41:53] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I know that feeling, there’s *unfortunately at times* no people that I truly hate ever. I always try and see the good in people and help and care for them even if they’re not the greatest of people to me
[2021-04-17 04:42:26] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Hey that’s ok:) I think you’re doing an amazing job right now telling me how you feel and the way things affect y
[2021-04-17 04:43:15] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: Yes!! You just describe what I feel ( with more precision)
[2021-04-17 04:44:20] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: There’s nothing wrong with that, sometimes you definitely need to be careful with some people as they tend to ||abuse||/exploit that but still I know that feeling and I wouldn’t say it’s a bad thing you just gotta be careful sometimes
[2021-04-17 04:44:26] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: Thnks, its because sometimes I write something tht can mean another thing for other people... and they missunderstood it, when it's cristal clear for me
[2021-04-17 04:45:38] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: So much is going on inside me, glad I could at least take this out to someone
[2021-04-17 04:46:08] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Well that’s also just the tax of human interactions right ? Sometimes people don’t see the same things you do or even interpret the same meanings behind the things you do. And  that goes for anyone:) I try to always put my self in peoples shoes and see it from their perspective AND from my view it makes supporting easier <:sakihehe:765711056454156309> <:whitewolfhehe:562392660795719717>  *trick of the trade I guess haha*
[2021-04-17 04:46:37] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Hey Life no worries at all my friend you can always dm me or make a private ticket:)
[2021-04-17 04:46:48] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I’m always here for you ok?:) along with everyone else here
[2021-04-17 04:46:59] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: We’re like a big family here. We care for another
[2021-04-17 04:48:51] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: Hmmm I used to do tht, but I got so much into it, tht I was, after helping the person, carying their problems...( sorry for the bad english) and It was affecting me really bad... so if you want I can give you some tips about tht later... ANYWAYS...
[2021-04-17 04:50:12] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: I-... idk if tht helps anything, but till now there are 3 points of my life where I suffered more... and one is very recent, I still suffering
[2021-04-17 04:51:07] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: No that was perfect English actually:) is English not your first language? Honestly, if so, I couldn’t tell that’s how good it is.

And honestly yeah, I know that sometimes you get attached to the people you help and like you said their problems carry weight in you as a person. It’s because your hearts compassionate. You sound a lot like myself I don’t want people to suffer or feel pain. Especially don’t want them to feel alone
[2021-04-17 04:51:27] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Do you wanna talk about it is it bothering you right now ?
[2021-04-17 04:52:13] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: Yes, I feel I can trust you now
[2021-04-17 04:54:28] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: It has to deal with lack of motivation, break of dreams (like, I dont have a dream anymore of what to do), a person tht is in comma but sees me as an "idol"... lemme organize how I will tell the other stuff...
[2021-04-17 04:56:05] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: Problems with my sister, dont want to disapoint my parents, not paying attention in classes, be the only ( or one of the only ones) tht dont cheat in the test...
[2021-04-17 04:57:19] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: Hmmm... the recent ||death|| of one of the dogs, have hurted someone and not had the chance to apologise
[2021-04-17 04:58:26] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: Hmmm... un-burring old feelings and thoughts to discover myself, and with tht, un-burring part of my past...
[2021-04-17 04:59:09] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: Hmmm... The fear of hurting someone Ik....
[2021-04-17 04:59:18] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: I think thi is it
[2021-04-17 05:01:12] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: Oh, yeah, there is more
[2021-04-17 05:01:34] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I’m glad you feel like you can trust me too honestly that means a lot to me and it makes me feel pretty good to know that:) well I think you got a lot on your plate and you’re letting your mind get to you ❤️ I know that pressure too, my mom was not well educated at all.. even has a ||learning disability|| which I don’t really like telling people (I trust you just as you do to me). She, ||as shitty as she was to me|| always pushed me to do well in school and I can’t knock her for that. I would bring joke 90s and I’d always get “why not a 100” and that’s pressure really stuck with me throughout my life thinking I had to be perfect 24/7
[2021-04-17 05:01:51] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Know that as long as you’re doing your best you should be satisfied with your outcome
[2021-04-17 05:03:23] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: As for paying attention in class is it voluntary or involuntary type of “not paying attention” Bc if it’s something you feel you can control you can try to fix that by reminding your self that some of these grade if you do end up going to college and wanting a career from it matter a decent amount. I know it sounds stressful but that is the truth those grades do matter:/
[2021-04-17 05:03:30] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: As for your sister I’m not sure what those problems are
[2021-04-17 05:04:04] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: As for the cheating too you don’t need to cheat to do well ❤️ I bet you’re doing fine just without it. It won’t help you in the long wrong to cheat
[2021-04-17 05:05:30] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: And as for the dog .. I’m really sorry:/ that really is shitty and I feel for you. It’s never easy and mourning and coping is handled so different for each person  when it comes to death all I can say is I’m sorry and that I’m here for you. 

As for burring old feelings I ALSO feel that lol some ex’s don’t deserve your heart. Depends on the situation though for sure
[2021-04-17 05:05:38] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: And of course the fear of hurting someone sucks too:(
[2021-04-17 05:06:04] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: Yeah but, I asked for a friend to help me in geography and she told me to cheat in the test to go well... tht was litterally all her help... and she was one person tht used to study a lot uk...
[2021-04-17 05:08:18] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: The grades wont matter anyways in the end... in Brazil they are worthless...and I dont know if I want to do college anymore
[2021-04-17 05:09:53] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: She haves angry issues, and, as far as ik its jealous of me (wait a sec my allergys are coming up)
[2021-04-17 05:11:39] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: (Ok, Im back)
[2021-04-17 05:13:01] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: It's not about the ex's... I think you took it too personal
[2021-04-17 05:14:08] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: It's about the time tht I was ||bullied|| as a kid....
[2021-04-17 05:15:54] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: •Yeah a lot of people cheat on test these days unfortunately. It’s sad:/ 
•well it depends on what you want to do if you want to move somewhere or stay there. But I have faith in you that you’ll figure it out and push yourself to do well:) 
•anger issues are tricky too to overcome or manage. I can give you to give to her some tricks that issues but I definitelysuggest that if it’s too out of hand for her to see someone. It helped with mine a lot and seeing a professional is always a good idea if you don’t know what to do 
•ahh sorry not about an ex I see
[2021-04-17 05:17:43] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: (It's interesting how we are so different and so close at the same time)
[2021-04-17 05:20:33] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: 1-) Yeo... y do I not then? Because I care too much about the ones Who are really carring and studying... thts so fool, I dont have motivation for study like this guys Who does... I dont have the futts to cheat because of those guys Who are studying... am I in a limbo?
[2021-04-17 05:22:28] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: 2-) where should I grab tohave tht motivation? I dont have any place to do tht...
[2021-04-17 05:22:52] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: 3-) I would really appreciate it
[2021-04-17 05:23:05] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: 4-) yep...
[2021-04-17 05:23:13] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: That’s the best part about talking to people and learning how they handle things. People can have such similarities and yet they 1% difference can make them a completely different person
[2021-04-17 05:24:10] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I think what you gotta remember is unfortunately those people making the decision to cheat are just cheating them selves. You don’t have to follow their footsteps you can be successful on your own me it’ll feel that much better knowing you did good and did it the right way
[2021-04-17 05:24:46] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I think you can find the motivation if you want good grades too you can maybe try rewarding your self after doing well
[2021-04-17 05:26:06] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: Look, Im really sorry, but Im so tired I see the letters of the board Im typing shake a bit
[2021-04-17 05:26:14] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: Can we talk tomorrow?
[2021-04-17 05:27:37] (427903354723631114) Life#4525: See you!!!...
[2021-04-17 05:28:07] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Hey that’s no problem my dms are open or open a ticket again for me:)
[2021-04-17 05:28:14] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I’ll close the ticket
[2021-04-17 05:28:32] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: <@&825323804548792330> anyone wanna help log and close?
