[2021-04-12 00:46:04] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Well thatâ€™s definitely not ok, I think that you should absolutely try to avoid being in areas around him without someone else there than, or maybe even tell your parents or someone about whatâ€™s going on. That does not sound at all ok:/
