[2021-04-26 18:55:02] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: Do you think you can power through it?

[2021-04-26 19:00:37] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: That's not great, what happened?
[2021-04-26 19:03:05] (816103117183123476) |-+ l o i c +-|#6610: so i put in my bio that i was co-fronting with another alter and he kept saying to ''stop faking it'' ''fictives don't exist''
[2021-04-26 19:03:59] (816103117183123476) |-+ l o i c +-|#6610: i told him: ||fictives are like alters but they have a source. so ex: the brain would think (insert character) ''imagine how well they could protect us from harm'' and that's how they're created. i and the others have no control over who it is or from what it is. (except a hyperfixation of some sort)||
[2021-04-26 19:04:23] (816103117183123476) |-+ l o i c +-|#6610: and he hasn't replied since but i'm just really scared

[2021-04-26 19:08:46] (816103117183123476) |-+ l o i c +-|#6610: not really
[2021-04-26 19:11:27] (816103117183123476) |-+ l o i c +-|#6610: we've talked about it a couple times and he kept saying
[2021-04-26 19:13:11] (816103117183123476) |-+ l o i c +-|#6610: or
[2021-04-26 19:15:38] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: That's pretty harsh of him to say
[2021-04-26 19:17:38] (816103117183123476) |-+ l o i c +-|#6610: yh.
[2021-04-26 19:18:01] (816103117183123476) |-+ l o i c +-|#6610: i keep trying to explain to him but it takes time

[2021-04-26 19:25:22] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: How is your anxiety doing now?
[2021-04-26 19:26:52] (816103117183123476) |-+ l o i c +-|#6610: i'm feeling better now but i'm ticing quite a lot

[2021-04-26 19:33:46] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: You mentioned you don't have a professional helping you out. Is it possible for you to get one? Learning coping mechanisms to help with anxiety, tics etc. is super useful

[2021-04-26 19:36:31] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: Since I don't share the same mental health history as you, I don't have the best recommendations but I'm sure you can find plenty and if you ask in the <#702178014192074775> channel, there might even be others in the server with experience!
[2021-04-26 19:37:42] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: It makes a huge difference to understand how and why you feel the ways that you do and how best to help yourself with them. It's worth spending some time to work on it!
