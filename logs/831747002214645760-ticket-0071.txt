[2021-04-14 04:39:13] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i get that responsibility makes us feel like we have to put others first but you're the most important person to yourself at the end of the day. you can't help others if you don't help yourself first.
[2021-04-14 04:40:29] (621571752895447091) Marley 🍓#0927: I...ig
[2021-04-14 04:41:52] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: it's time to take care of yourself for a bit. show yourself the love you show others. have you tried journalling your feelings down?
[2021-04-14 04:42:27] (621571752895447091) Marley 🍓#0927: No...i..i dont have good handariteing...so ive never tried it

[2021-04-14 04:49:20] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i'm glad it's at least relaxing for you. there are a bunch of other coping mechanisms that can help.

[2021-04-14 04:52:00] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i would refrain from using any harming coping mechanisms though
[2021-04-14 04:52:07] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: they're only causing you more hurt
[2021-04-14 04:52:41] (621571752895447091) Marley 🍓#0927: Ill..ill try its hars not too...

[2021-04-14 05:00:07] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: ||suicide|| isn't the best option. i know it seems like it because of how awful things seem but things do get better and they will get better. i know you probably hear that often but it's true. just take life one day at a time right now.
[2021-04-14 05:02:43] (621571752895447091) Marley 🍓#0927: Just...i-i dont know what else to do...i cant keep fighting like this...i cant keep it up supporting friends doing school after and before school thinga online classes and then a leagal battle on top of it...and bullying disceiminashion and abuse...i-i dont know what else to do
[2021-04-14 05:05:40] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i understand. you have to give yourself a break from all the responsibilities you have right now. that's a different option that you have. there are other ways to change how your life is going other than ||death||
