[2021-04-21 02:54:31] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: do you mind describing your issue with our rule?
[2021-04-21 02:56:56] (820693593785237535) vampire#3465: I think rule number 13 should be more specific because people who have experience and went through sexual harassment should be able to talk about it out of the NSFW channel.  Rule number 13 does not say much and is not specified enough
[2021-04-21 02:58:45] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: Since ||sexual harassment and assault|| are under the listed terms to censor, they're allowed to be discussed in heavy channels. However, people are not allowed to go into details regarding exactly what happened since that goes into the territory of NSFW. The conversation you were having with Dino was NSFW though and doesn't have anything to do with ||sexual harassment or assault||.
[2021-04-21 03:02:48] (820693593785237535) vampire#3465: was not talking about Dino. But back to the reason about rule number 13, i ask you to specify more on the rule and explain it.
[2021-04-21 03:03:41] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: No discussion of NSFW things in a non NSFW channel. That's it.
[2021-04-21 03:05:24] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: I've already stated that it's ok to discuss ||sexual trauma|| as long as it's not in detail. The words ||sexual trauma|| aren
[2021-04-21 03:09:49] (820693593785237535) vampire#3465: ||so what if someone was experiencing sexual trauma and wanted to kill themselves.  and since they are under age they cant talk about the sexual trauma they are going through. So they sent help in a heavy chat. I wonder if you would help them or maybe tell them they are violating the rules.||
[2021-04-21 03:10:54] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: They're free to file a private support ticket if they would like to talk about it but we have the no NSFW rule for a reason.
[2021-04-21 03:11:22] (820693593785237535) vampire#3465: so they would have to wait to get help
[2021-04-21 03:12:24] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: Private support is fairly fast at getting support for someone.
[2021-04-21 03:14:43] (820693593785237535) vampire#3465: ||a bullet is faster and a knife digging into someone is quicker than having to wait for support||
[2021-04-21 03:15:00] (820693593785237535) vampire#3465: ||well if that was real you would just let someone killed themselves and decided that rules were more precious than saving a life||
[2021-04-21 03:15:23] (820693593785237535) vampire#3465: i appreciate you taking the time to have this conversation with me
[2021-04-21 03:15:41] (820693593785237535) vampire#3465: i hope you have a good rest of your day!
[2021-04-21 03:16:14] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: I'm sorry but moderators have final decision. You're going to get 3 strikes for having an NSFW conversations outside of a NSFW channel and 3 strikes for fighting with a moderator about a decision. This will result in 24 hour mute since you've broken the rules before.
[2021-04-21 03:18:45] (820693593785237535) vampire#3465: okay! have a good day
