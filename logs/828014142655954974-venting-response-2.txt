um. so im queer right? closeted transmasc etc. etc. however. my mom is really homophobic and transphobic, my whole family is. however, she holds the most weight in my head n heart. she has this 'morality' superiority complex where spiritually/religiously she's "always" right and so on. 
so anyways, when i was in 9th grade ( 11th now ) she went through my phone and saw i was dating a girl and was still in contact with a friend i wasn't supposed to be talking to. anyways, lots of yelling and the like. i was dealing w internalized homophobia and at the time i just pushed down my transness cause yeah. 
anyways. now im dating a new girl and shes great but in forever worried about my mom finding out. i always control my expressions and movement and tone of voice but im worried shell find out. and if she does, it could hurt my girlfriend. i can handle pain but i don't want my girlfriend to be hurt. idk what to do. I'm so nervous usually i feel like im always gonna be found out. im considering pushing my girlfriend away and then her eventually leaving but i just dk :/

|| Death has been on my mind a lot. Specifically, my own. I want to be done with this life. I know that's something I can control but there's so many complications. 
I really just want to go back to wherever I was before I was born. Even if it's nothingness, it would be better than being here and I wouldn't notice anyway. 
I'm just so tired. So worn down. I'm nowhere near old enough to have lived a full life but, I feel like I've experienced enough pain for three lifetimes and I just.. I don't want this anymore.||

[2021-04-11 00:52:44] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I went to the mall with my mom today and I got the stuff I was looking for, but we got into a huge argument in public and I know it’s all my fault but I just need to talk about it I guess...
So my mom has a habit of not giving a shit when I’m uncomfortable, she just doesn’t respect my feelings (never has, never will). We were in a big, crowded store, and she wanted to look at ||sports bras|| and regular ones for her and me to get and I had told her I didn’t feel comfortable doing that in such a populated place. Well, the dressing rooms were closed ||because of the pandemic|| and she decided she would just try on a ||bra|| over her clothes. In the middle of a huge crowded store. Not only could we get in trouble for doing that, but it’s way too embarrassing for me and I said I wouldn’t feel comfortable doing that. 
She just said I didn’t have to and that I could walk away, but she just didn’t even listen to me (she never does) and it escalated into me saying that I ||hated her and that I wouldn’t forgive her for embarrassing me. ||
I don’t know what’s wrong with me, every time I’m around her I just get upset, and she’s always pushing my buttons. I had to leave the store because I was so embarrassed and mad at her. I apologized later because I knew I had to, but she used it against me anyway. 
I feel like shit for letting her get to me. I feel like I’m ||emotionally manipulating or even abusive toward her, and if that’s true I need to get out of here and be alone for the rest of my life so I can stop hurting her and people I care about.||
[2021-04-11 00:57:39] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: You are not the one in the wrong here. You aren’t ||emotionally manipulative|| to your mother or even ||abusive||, you explicitly told her you weren’t comfortable but she didn’t care. And there’s nothing wrong with you, people when they are very overwhelmed or stressed, tend to say certain things that are a bit more hurtful and as you said you mother pushes your buttons so it’s obvious all that you will react.

My parents tend to have a hard time dealing with it because they simply don't understand it. I've gotten into may arguments about it, especially with my father, but it's not a bad thing to express how you feel uncomfortable. You were in the right, and I'm really sorry she made you feel that way.

And I’m kinda pissed at my sister too, even though she’s the best, she’s doing something that she knows will hurt me and doesn’t seem to care. And I’m not the closest with my dad. My family sucks, I want to move out and stop talking to all of them. But then I’ll have no one irl left 😞 I’ll still be stuck with myself, who is probably the worst of my entire family. Great. I guess my couple weeks of feeling happy are over

Or average. There’s nothing that I’m great at that would ever make me seem cool or smart or different. 
Like sure I can crochet, but that’s something basically anyone can do, and I can’t even follow a crochet pattern correctly.

You are enough, okay? You are amazing and perfect just the way you are and there’s NOTHING wrong with you. Also, if it helps you feel less alone, I suck at science stuff too, like one time I even had a F- on Physics and even basic math confuses me. And no, not everyone can’t crochet, I can’t crochet for example, so that’s something you can do that some people can’t.

That is the MAIN reason why I want to have a adoption. The other reason is I never wanted KIDS. EVER!!!! Did y'all not hear me say since forever that I do not want to have kids? I even said that I wanted to get my tubes tied when I turn 18. I even premeditated this and said if I do get pregnant it would be an accident and I would probably abort it or put it up for adoption. Why do y'all think after EVERYTHING I SAID that I would happily have my child and love it forever? I never wanted kids and I think I should not be forced to have them if I never wanted them. 


Why do y'all act like I'm the only girl in my family that can have a child? When I'm the only person in my family THAT DO NOT EVER WANTED CHILDREN IN MY LIFE ...EVER. You can have your first grandchild. But it doesn't have to be my child. It do not have to be from me..from a person that never wanted to have kids in the first place. ||

Why would I purposely choose to do something if im going to regret it later? Especially if it something that premeditated for Years and thought about it for YEARS. Why would do it if I will regret it? My logic is that if purposely choose to it then I have NO REASON to regret it. NONE WHAT SO EVER. I don't understand what would y'all think would be a reason for me to regret something that I always wanted to do?



I'm suicidal because I do not want a kid but yet y'all forcing me to have it because ...I don't really know why y'all forcing me to have it other then y'all have this notion in y'all head that this is the only child that y'all will ever get a chance to have or something like that. And I'm suicidal because y'al not supporting me in my choices but yet saying y'all support me but y'all aren't actively supporting me? I do not want to kill myself because I'm scared of Havin my first child nor I think no one will support my child. Stop thinking this.||

I see some other people have GAD irl, and even though I know that I will probably never see their struggles because others can't see mine either, I just feel like they are doing way better than me. I feel like I relate a lot more to the psych example videos of people with GAD than irl people with GAD lol

[2021-04-22 02:06:25] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I can’t even describe how depressed I am right now, how depressed I’ve been since Sunday night. I know it’s only been 3 days. I know that’s nothing. But ever since Sunday night I’ve been ||wanting to end everything for myself||. I feel like I deserve it. Or whatever is worse.
I have therapy tomorrow, but 17 hours seems so far away even though I’ll probably sleep most of it away. I hate being in these emotional slumps. And even when I’m in the therapy session, I don’t know if I’ll be too scared to say what’s going on. My psychiatrist was under the impression that I was fine yesterday since she didn’t really give me an opportunity to describe how bad things are. 
||I’m just scared that I’m gonna be sent to a hospital or end up dying, and then the people I care about will see what a crappy person I was||
