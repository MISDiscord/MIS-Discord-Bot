um. so im queer right? closeted transmasc etc. etc. however. my mom is really homophobic and transphobic, my whole family is. however, she holds the most weight in my head n heart. she has this 'morality' superiority complex where spiritually/religiously she's "always" right and so on. 
so anyways, when i was in 9th grade ( 11th now ) she went through my phone and saw i was dating a girl and was still in contact with a friend i wasn't supposed to be talking to. anyways, lots of yelling and the like. i was dealing w internalized homophobia and at the time i just pushed down my transness cause yeah. 
anyways. now im dating a new girl and shes great but in forever worried about my mom finding out. i always control my expressions and movement and tone of voice but im worried shell find out. and if she does, it could hurt my girlfriend. i can handle pain but i don't want my girlfriend to be hurt. idk what to do. I'm so nervous usually i feel like im always gonna be found out. im considering pushing my girlfriend away and then her eventually leaving but i just dk :/

|| Death has been on my mind a lot. Specifically, my own. I want to be done with this life. I know that's something I can control but there's so many complications. 
I really just want to go back to wherever I was before I was born. Even if it's nothingness, it would be better than being here and I wouldn't notice anyway. 
I'm just so tired. So worn down. I'm nowhere near old enough to have lived a full life but, I feel like I've experienced enough pain for three lifetimes and I just.. I don't want this anymore.||
