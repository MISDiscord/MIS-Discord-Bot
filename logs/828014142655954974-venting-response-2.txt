um. so im queer right? closeted transmasc etc. etc. however. my mom is really homophobic and transphobic, my whole family is. however, she holds the most weight in my head n heart. she has this 'morality' superiority complex where spiritually/religiously she's "always" right and so on. 
so anyways, when i was in 9th grade ( 11th now ) she went through my phone and saw i was dating a girl and was still in contact with a friend i wasn't supposed to be talking to. anyways, lots of yelling and the like. i was dealing w internalized homophobia and at the time i just pushed down my transness cause yeah. 
anyways. now im dating a new girl and shes great but in forever worried about my mom finding out. i always control my expressions and movement and tone of voice but im worried shell find out. and if she does, it could hurt my girlfriend. i can handle pain but i don't want my girlfriend to be hurt. idk what to do. I'm so nervous usually i feel like im always gonna be found out. im considering pushing my girlfriend away and then her eventually leaving but i just dk :/

|| Death has been on my mind a lot. Specifically, my own. I want to be done with this life. I know that's something I can control but there's so many complications. 
I really just want to go back to wherever I was before I was born. Even if it's nothingness, it would be better than being here and I wouldn't notice anyway. 
I'm just so tired. So worn down. I'm nowhere near old enough to have lived a full life but, I feel like I've experienced enough pain for three lifetimes and I just.. I don't want this anymore.||

[2021-04-11 00:52:44] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I went to the mall with my mom today and I got the stuff I was looking for, but we got into a huge argument in public and I know it’s all my fault but I just need to talk about it I guess...
So my mom has a habit of not giving a shit when I’m uncomfortable, she just doesn’t respect my feelings (never has, never will). We were in a big, crowded store, and she wanted to look at ||sports bras|| and regular ones for her and me to get and I had told her I didn’t feel comfortable doing that in such a populated place. Well, the dressing rooms were closed ||because of the pandemic|| and she decided she would just try on a ||bra|| over her clothes. In the middle of a huge crowded store. Not only could we get in trouble for doing that, but it’s way too embarrassing for me and I said I wouldn’t feel comfortable doing that. 
She just said I didn’t have to and that I could walk away, but she just didn’t even listen to me (she never does) and it escalated into me saying that I ||hated her and that I wouldn’t forgive her for embarrassing me. ||
I don’t know what’s wrong with me, every time I’m around her I just get upset, and she’s always pushing my buttons. I had to leave the store because I was so embarrassed and mad at her. I apologized later because I knew I had to, but she used it against me anyway. 
I feel like shit for letting her get to me. I feel like I’m ||emotionally manipulating or even abusive toward her, and if that’s true I need to get out of here and be alone for the rest of my life so I can stop hurting her and people I care about.||
[2021-04-11 00:57:39] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: You are not the one in the wrong here. You aren’t ||emotionally manipulative|| to your mother or even ||abusive||, you explicitly told her you weren’t comfortable but she didn’t care. And there’s nothing wrong with you, people when they are very overwhelmed or stressed, tend to say certain things that are a bit more hurtful and as you said you mother pushes your buttons so it’s obvious all that you will react.

My parents tend to have a hard time dealing with it because they simply don't understand it. I've gotten into may arguments about it, especially with my father, but it's not a bad thing to express how you feel uncomfortable. You were in the right, and I'm really sorry she made you feel that way.

And I’m kinda pissed at my sister too, even though she’s the best, she’s doing something that she knows will hurt me and doesn’t seem to care. And I’m not the closest with my dad. My family sucks, I want to move out and stop talking to all of them. But then I’ll have no one irl left 😞 I’ll still be stuck with myself, who is probably the worst of my entire family. Great. I guess my couple weeks of feeling happy are over

Like sure I can crochet, but that’s something basically anyone can do, and I can’t even follow a crochet pattern correctly.

You are enough, okay? You are amazing and perfect just the way you are and there’s NOTHING wrong with you. Also, if it helps you feel less alone, I suck at science stuff too, like one time I even had a F- on Physics and even basic math confuses me. And no, not everyone can’t crochet, I can’t crochet for example, so that’s something you can do that some people can’t.

[2021-04-12 10:11:22] (726689449995534387) The Flaming Phoenix#2474: not like run away from your problems, but base your well-being off of other's well-being
[2021-04-12 10:11:49] (726689449995534387) The Flaming Phoenix#2474: you try to do something nice for someone and there's a little warmth in your chest
[2021-04-12 10:11:59] (726689449995534387) The Flaming Phoenix#2474: even if the person isn't nice back
[2021-04-12 16:57:56] (398898064313548820) Leboge#3392: My routine is falling apart again, why do I even work so hard on it when I can't maintain it
[2021-04-12 19:32:09] (805758896773398538) pumpkin (they/she)#1231: ||i shouldn't have confessed to her she feels nothing for me only hate||
[2021-04-13 12:59:07] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: So aggravated, hehe. I feel like I shouldn't seek help or treatment because of my self-doubt and also my hard-headedness of, "I can do this myself". iajkcidjkicxkls
[2021-04-13 13:02:59] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I hate that I have moments of overwhelming self-confidence and others with incessant self-doubt, and both are sabotaging my ability to seek professional help.
[2021-04-13 13:12:02] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: ...I guess whether I like it or not though, even my regular thinking is sick because, who wastes so much time thinking about this stuff? It's been on my mind for 1 & 1/2 months now. That's not really... "healthy".
[2021-04-13 14:09:09] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: idk I'm still confused even as I try to convince myself o(TヘTo)

[2021-04-13 14:22:04] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Definitely, I agree. It's just so hard to apply that to **m*E***
[2021-04-13 14:22:20] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: and this is true. Maybe that's what I meant
[2021-04-13 14:23:14] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: I hope I can get a **grip** to just HAVE THE CONVERSATION
[2021-04-13 14:23:49] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: But yeah I think I need to buckle down and do something about it. I haven't been sleeping well because of it and my cognitive health is suffering

[2021-04-13 21:12:37] (398898064313548820) Leboge#3392: What is wrong with me why am I permanently paranoid
Whatever I do, I always feel like my parents or simeone else is listening to me, watching me
Why cant I just relax and be on my own
When I close the door of my room I sometimes still think that my parents are standing at my door and observing what I'm doing
[2021-04-13 21:13:34] (398898064313548820) Leboge#3392: When I go outside I think that all the people are watching me through their windows
[2021-04-14 12:38:03] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Hey <@!398898064313548820> , can't really help per se but I can sort of get why you'd feel that fear, have you seen a professional about it to maybe try to get some help with paranoia?
[2021-04-14 12:39:37] (398898064313548820) Leboge#3392: I talked to him about it, but he didnt really help me, I think I'm going to talk about it again next time
[2021-04-14 12:42:52] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: That sounds like a good plan, I hope it goes well :>
[2021-04-14 18:51:51] (779327825429004329) Certified_Goat#5214: i accidentally hurt someone i care about a lot. and like, i hurt from being lonely rn. but i feel like i deserve it. everyone tells me i am too hard on myself and i don't deserve to beat myself up over this stuff. but i still feel like i deserve it. i'm not sure what i'm looking for here, but i guess it just feels nice to say it.
[2021-04-14 19:32:50] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: Do you want to talk about it more maybe?
[2021-04-14 19:53:26] (779327825429004329) Certified_Goat#5214: i dunno, i've suppressed it a lot and i don't know if i am completely ready to pull the rest of that up.
[2021-04-14 19:56:10] (214852868837081089) Aralienne#7359: That's okay then! My DMs are open if you ever feel like sharing though. Hurting someone always sucks but there is such a thing as taking too much blame. Be kind to yourself too!
