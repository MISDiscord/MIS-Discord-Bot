[2021-04-16 20:40:17] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: So with school is it a test taking thing or is it the actual material retention? Is there a tutor or extra time you can spend by any chance to help those grades?:!
[2021-04-16 20:45:14] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: no i just cant focus and do anything
[2021-04-16 20:45:29] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: and i dont really have any motivation do do it
[2021-04-16 20:48:18] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Well do you find anything interesting in your classes?

[2021-04-16 20:52:29] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Well maybe you can spend a little extra time studying if you have the time or maybe ask for extra time with tests or stay after school for help?:)
[2021-04-16 20:54:48] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: And I mean it’s normal to not do well with your grades I think that’s ok not every single person is like an A+ honor student too
[2021-04-16 20:55:38] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: It stinks but when you have these types of things you work twice as hard than someone without these things
