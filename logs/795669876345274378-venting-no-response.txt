I'm trying so fucking hard to recover from my eating disorder and it feels like I'm wearing a blindfold searching for a needle in a haystack. Somedays I hate my body and other days I'm not sure. I've avoided checking my weight for so long and now I have a doctor's appointment today and I'm scared. I don't want to see the number. I don't think I'm going to eat until after the appointment because I'll have shit in my system.
