What a fucking joke
Like I can just *decide* that the bad stuff doesn't affect me anymore. Like I can just magically be okay the moment I take my meds. They tell me to stop ||cutting||, but I can't. I say no. Go ahead, take whatever you want, but I'm sneaky, just the way I was raised. I still ||self-harm|| because they're the ones stressing me out.
I want them to stop relying on me. That's what I am, y'know. I am a friend to lean on, someone you *always* call on if you're feeling bad, the one you vent to until you feel empty. The one you depend on, lean on, and need to stop you from ||killing yourself||.
Just lovely. Now I can't do a damn thing with my own life. I can't move forward, and *I* can't even ||commit suicide|| because they all need me. Why the fuck can't they call someone who has their shit together?
But it doesn't matter. If I have to, I'll leave them all. Why? Because I'm a damn coward. I'll leave them all, turn 18, then fly away to Scotland so I'll never bother anyone ever again. Maybe then they'll be okay.
