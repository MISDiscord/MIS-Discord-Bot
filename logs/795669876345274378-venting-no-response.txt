[2021-04-21 11:42:27] (653011387806646294) Student#9104: I‚Äôm really not cut out for this world. It doesn‚Äôt make sense for me to keep trying because I always end up feeling stupid for it, to keep hoping because I‚Äôm tired of feeling disappointed, to keep wishing because it will never ever happen. I really am invisible, alone, and meaningless in this world. Pathetic and a loser. ||Disappearing forever makes the most sense||, and that‚Äôs just how I feel.
[2021-04-21 13:52:10] (690320974926970881) jia#0951: Goodness, I date men who disappoint me over and over. I date men who never put in effort to keep the relationship going. I get it, you're tired, you've had a long day, I understand how tired you are but goodness is it that hard to text more than just One Word in a day.
[2021-04-21 13:53:48] (690320974926970881) jia#0951: You told me to tell you when I'm tired, when I'm too tired of waiting. I'm tired. I'm so so tired but I don't want to let you go. I'm so tired of your absence and I'm afraid one day I'll get used to it and it'll be like we're not even together anymore but Christ, I'm so tired of waiting for a message from you.

I want to be happy and chill but every time I talk to ppl or see people, I feel so much rage and anger. Why does everyone have to seem so united and happy, and why I am the only one who‚Äôs miserable? What‚Äôs wrong with me?!
[2021-04-21 13:58:25] (695635702364241930) üéá Hecate üí´#6865: Why do I have so much anger in me, why do I want to hurt others, why can‚Äôt I be happy???

[2021-04-22 06:44:57] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: ||Why did you have to do that to me? you fucked up my life, fucked up my head, and made me lose so many friends. My social life is fucking gone because of you and nobody treats me the same after they hear my story. Fuck you Evelyn and your new gf too, I guess she learned how to shit-talk because of you. You toxic bitch. I wish I never met you, I would be so much happier and have less than 5 attempts on taking my life. You abused me mentally, fucked with my head, you seemed like the good guy for the longest time until a friend of mine told me how bad you were. You used me, and I'm glad you're fucking gone.||

[2021-04-24 04:09:06] (510757842505039872) Ajmc#8880: Last night I got on 1 knee
I held your hand and told u how much u meant to me
I broke down from it
I professed everything I feel for u
The I saw the massages he was sending....
And Ik u wouldn't cheat
And Ik u won't 
But I'm scared you'll realise hes better
I'm scared bc I can never type the things he did
I'm scared you'll leave me for him
For his sweet words and his hugs
Ik u used to like him
Ik that u started to fall even tho u picked me and u won't admit it
But I'm still scared
I'm so fucking scared 
And I don't wanna tell u and start a fight
I truly love u
Please don't hurt me again....
I can't take that...
