[2021-04-08 22:39:44] (689997457966235669) paupizza#7297: I don't want likes, I want someone to message me telling me if I'm okay and they're there for me, but all my "friends" are geocentric, they don't fucking care about me, I'm at my limit, I want this to be my end, the only thing that doesn't let me it's my dog, but I feel like horrible all the time, want someone I can talk to, I want someone to tell me everything's going to be okay, I want a friend, a real one, but everyone I talk to treats me like I'm nothing, like I'm something they can talk to whenever they want, I wait and wait and nothing, I hate them I hate me I hate this.
