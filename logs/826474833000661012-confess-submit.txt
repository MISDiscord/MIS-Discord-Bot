[2021-04-11 15:36:00] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: CW: kinda self-deprecating but not really.

Anyone ever had a moment where they're trying to be mean to themselves, or are talking to someone and are trying to be humble and make yourself believe the humble thoughts, but in the back of your mind just think, *I'm a pretty great person* and thoughts like that which are **NOT** humble at all, and almost boasting? But then you try to shut it out with the other thoughts in hopes that it will replace the internal conscience? Idk, just me?
[2021-04-11 15:39:16] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Actually, maybe I should listen to those thoughts more often. I'd have a lot more confidence, lol. Just gotta get rid of the part where it thinks I'm *better*...
