Private support is ran by the Support Moderators with the Private Support Team. We aim to provide a support service which is more private and orientated to the one user. All supporters are volunteers and should be treated as such. 

When opening a ticket, please briefly talk about what you would like support about and any triggering topics that may come up. Spoilers are to be not used at the supporters discretion so please ask before not using spoilers. With this, please do not reping the Private Support Team if your ticket has been unanswered for LESS than 2 hours. You may reping after the two hour mark. We apologise that our supporters cannot get to you as soon as you would like.

Support Tickets cannot exceed a 2 hour long conversation. Our supporters are unable to continue to support for so long. Supporters may swap out supporters in the ticket but the 2 hour time limit still applies from when the first conversation took place. 

Please let the Private Supporter close the ticket to be able to log correctly and make sure you are safe before closing the ticket and ending the support. You may ask the supporter to close the ticket for you but please refrain from closing the ticket yourself.

Our supporters work very hard so please remember to show your appreciation for our amazing support members.

If you have an issue with a Support member or Moderator, please DM <@!396441108995112970> with your issues so it can be resolved quickly. 

We also have currently open Support Applications, please fill out this application https://forms.gle/CA8o3ojZTTRAMokTA

Any questions, feel free to open a ticket and ask them <:NekoLovePeek:819688620495339581>
