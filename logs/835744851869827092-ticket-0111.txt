Maybe you can get ta tutor, or create a reward system that if you study for a long time during the week you can reward yourself with maybe a treat or something small you want. I would make sure you’re mom is ok first and tell her that you want to fix this and will work on it and to trust you
[2021-04-25 05:28:13] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: <@200391976837840896> yeah well the exam is over

[2021-04-25 05:30:15] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Just because the exams are over doesn’t mean you can’t still boost your grades. Maybe you can talk to your professors and ask them if you can either redo the test or maybe do some extra work to boost your grades and help you out.
[2021-04-25 05:30:16] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: i will try harder in my next life

You can find happiness and success your high school grades can’t dictate your entire life I know there school is everything and it does mean skit in your future but it’s not as if the world now is over you know? It means you may need to work harder yes but it’s not over

[2021-04-25 06:25:56] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Well I can answer that for sure if you’d like, people get comfortable sometimes with bad habits. i think a lot of people do and especially because of the pandemic peoples daily life and the things they do change. Their values and motivation has changed too, our lives are changed from these things. We get comfortable ins routine and it’s hard sometimes to break it. Change sometimes is perceived as bad
[2021-04-25 06:26:15] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: It’s not that you’re a brat or deserve to be punished by any means
[2021-04-25 06:26:56] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I think it shows emotional maturity and stability to accept to yourself that you’ve made a mistake and you try your hardest to fix it)
[2021-04-25 06:30:00] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I think I’m this situation it sounds like truly there might not be an option to make your grades become better grades from the way you’re making it sound but there’s always the stuff you do after that shows your character

[2021-04-25 07:34:05] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: You will:) it may not happen over night but maybe try and give your self some motivation and incentives to work there every day by giving yourself mini rewards for good and hard work towards it
[2021-04-25 07:39:44] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: <@200391976837840896> Well I did try a rewarding system

[2021-04-25 08:04:35] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I think you should seriously talk to your mother about the situation and your options, I think recommended a therapist
[2021-04-25 08:04:53] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: A trained professional can help with these issues
[2021-04-25 08:05:18] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: And as for losing everyone you can still make new friends from school and online:) no matter the grades

[2021-04-25 09:36:01] (834132395014750269) goshs#2990: <@200391976837840896> Hello
[2021-04-25 09:52:01] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: unfortunately para is asleep right since he lives in est time zone
[2021-04-25 14:21:01] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Hey I’m sorry I was asleep, I think that maybe even for you and your coping needs that maybe letting this all out to a professional like a therapist can really help too
[2021-04-25 14:25:11] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Respectfully of course, I think that it sounds like you feel like you’re stuck and that now anything you do life is pointless because the only thing that mattered was your grades and you’re telling me there’s nothing that can be done to change those grades. I think you need a good group of family and friends to support you, I think that your life isn’t over, I think there’s always room and time to turn things around, I think that life isn’t going to be based solely off a number from some exam, you can find friends and love and happiness and success through so many other means, I think you can prove to your mother than you ARE a hard worker if you actually put in the time and effort and with a little help from people can get your things together and apply yourself because to me it sounds like you’re a smart kid that as you said before never applied themselves and ignored the warnings. Life is precious and something that can change in seconds I mean look how life has changed already from covid and no one predicted that you know?
[2021-04-25 14:26:06] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Things can change and turn around in a moments notice, this isn’t the time to give up and succumb to your mistakes, this is a time to build up your courage to finally fight back and make your mother and yourself  proud by doing what you should have for all these years
[2021-04-25 20:53:34] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Can I close this ticket?
