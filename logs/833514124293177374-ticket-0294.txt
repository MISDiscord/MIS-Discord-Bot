[2021-04-19 01:29:49] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Ok I wasnâ€™t sure if someone being close to ||sh-ing|| counted as active danger (in the support rules chat) but Student messaged me after pinging support and what they said that made me nervous was that they had their stuff ready to ||sh|| with. I am doing my best to make sure they donâ€™t do that but the words just arenâ€™t coming out right and I donâ€™t know if theyâ€™re going to do it. I apologize if active danger only meant ||suicide||
[2021-04-19 01:30:33] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Also, I donâ€™t know whether to tell them that I pinged this, and if Iâ€™m in the wrong place I apologize and must have clicked the wrong thing
[2021-04-19 02:32:58] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: hi weehehe. sorry for the late reply. we canâ€™t do anything anything more than refer them to multiple crisis hotlines to contact. however, you can always tell him to open a private support ticket and someone will be there to help me with the urge to ||sh||.
[2021-04-19 02:35:17] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Okay. Thank you.
[2021-04-19 02:36:34] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: are there any other ways i can help you tonight?
[2021-04-19 02:40:37] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Actually yes. Itâ€™s unrelated, but this made me realize I donâ€™t want to be a mod, so yall can ignore my application (and please do not tell me whether I would have ever made it in or whatever, I think it would be better for me to not know either way.) thanks! Iâ€™m also going to take off my support role. Iâ€™m okay, Iâ€™m just not good at dms about mental health
[2021-04-19 02:54:13] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i understand. thank you so much for applying. i hope that you continue to find support through this server in the future. thank you for all youâ€™ve done for others in the past. we all really appreciate it.
[2021-04-19 02:55:28] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Thank you! Iâ€™ll still try to help too but not in dms, thanks ðŸ™‚ (You can close this ticket now oof)
[2021-04-19 02:55:44] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: of course.
