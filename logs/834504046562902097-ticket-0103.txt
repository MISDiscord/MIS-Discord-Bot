Hello. I was abit hesistant to ask for help because im extremelt ashamed of it and it makes me feel like an awful person. I cheated on my partner a two years ago. Ive told him a year after and we broke up for a while but got back together. I love this man to ||death|| and i couldnt imagine being with anyone else but the guilt is killing me

[2021-04-21 19:05:25] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i understand feeling shame for what happened. i think what matters is whether you would do it again in the present day.
[2021-04-21 19:05:34] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: i wont ever

[2021-04-21 19:05:46] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: hes very unforgiving
[2021-04-21 19:05:47] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: in general
[2021-04-21 19:05:54] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: it doesnt make him a bad person
[2021-04-21 19:05:55] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: he just is

[2021-04-21 19:06:13] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: full of hate for myself in general
[2021-04-21 19:06:15] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: i hate myself
[2021-04-21 19:06:17] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: i hate my body
[2021-04-21 19:06:25] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: i hate the way i talk
[2021-04-21 19:06:27] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: i hate what i do
[2021-04-21 19:06:31] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: im so negative god
[2021-04-21 19:06:40] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: sorry i sound really pathetic right now
[2021-04-21 19:08:01] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: you're not sounding pathetic. you sound like someone who is dealing with a lot and doesn't know how to cope with it. i know it's hard when you can't get closure for something. sometimes we have to learn to cope with the idea that we will never get that closure. but i think the knowledge you would never do it again is what's important right now.
[2021-04-21 19:08:13] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: it is
[2021-04-21 19:08:15] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: okay..
[2021-04-21 19:08:25] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: i feel valid
[2021-04-21 19:08:42] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: i just wish i wasnt like this
[2021-04-21 19:09:01] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: i think i just have to go take my medication
[2021-04-21 19:09:03] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: and go to bed
[2021-04-21 19:09:08] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: ill wake up better tomorrow
[2021-04-21 19:09:14] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: sorry if i wasted your time
[2021-04-21 19:10:07] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: you didn't waste my time. i'm here because i want to be here.

[2021-04-21 19:10:40] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: not yet
[2021-04-21 19:10:46] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: i used to write a diary
[2021-04-21 19:10:55] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: back years ago
[2021-04-21 19:11:07] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: but what i wrote in the old diary triggers me

[2021-04-21 19:11:37] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i would recommend trying it again or meditation if that doesn't work for you
[2021-04-21 19:11:42] (211511908833034240) HellsByte#8073: maybe that would help
