[2021-04-17 16:22:21] (411683536026992641) ChitsyFreemo#6587: Any noodle ya want 

Parsly, basil, chives, rosemary, chilly powder, red pepper flakes, seasoning salt, salt and pepper. 

Butter, velveta cheese, milk. 

[Or any cheese blend] 

Best use a large pot


Boil noodles to the softness you like 

Strain


About 1/4 cup of milk to 1/2 or more depending on amount of noodles 

Put milk, butter, and cheese into pot before noodles. As much as you want, more milk and butter makes it creamy. About 1 inch of cheese from the block or 2 inches is good. 

Put seasonings into a cup, judge based on noodle amount. 

[Add chili pepper, and red pepper flakes, possible Oregano. If wanted spicy] 

Dump noodles into pot with milk cheese and butter, and slowly add seasonings while mixing. 

Mix till cheese is fully melted.


Put into a bowl,[ shake some parmesan cheese on top and add some bacon bits. If wanted extra toppings]


This is a recipe that I kinda just wrote up to give to a friend, im no expert at writing them XD.

I saw/heard John Glenn speak and several other astronauts as they are also big plane buffs  (hoping none of this broke any "promotion rules" I have othing to do with the EAA just lived in Oshkosh for 8 years)
