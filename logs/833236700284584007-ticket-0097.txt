[2021-04-18 07:07:28] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: hey Marley, you don’t need to censor in chat with me! can you do some breathing exercises for me? or maybe some fact checking if you are comfy?
[2021-04-18 07:07:45] (621571752895447091) Marley 🍓#0927: S-sure
[2021-04-18 07:08:14] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: okay so fact checking is just reminding yourself things like “i am safe now” “no one is going to hurt me” “i am okay”
[2021-04-18 07:08:44] (621571752895447091) Marley 🍓#0927: O-ok
[2021-04-18 07:08:49] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: and for breathing exercise if it helps i have a gif or a couple other methods! if you have one feel free to do it, if not let me know and i’ll share one:3!
[2021-04-18 07:09:29] (621571752895447091) Marley 🍓#0927: O-ok...c-can you share...o-one?
[2021-04-18 07:12:31] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: sure! one i like to do is with your hand, hold one hand out and with your other hand point to middle of your wrist. as you breathe in trace that finger up to the edge of your pink, lightly pinch it as you hold your breath, and as you exhale trace your finger back down to your wrist. do that trace up, hold, release method for all your fingers!
[2021-04-18 07:13:22] (621571752895447091) Marley 🍓#0927: O-ok thank you...and sorry for bugging tou about this

[2021-04-18 07:16:33] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: and just keep repeating “i am safe” “everything will be okay” and things like that ! you can do it

[2021-04-18 07:20:29] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: healing takes time, acknowledging it and realizing you need to heal is the first steps so i’m really proud of you! you are not alone
