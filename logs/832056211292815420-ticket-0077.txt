[2021-04-15 00:54:51] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: hey bethy, mind telling me what's going on?
[2021-04-15 00:54:59] (683525703425196109) ðŸ’™-Misâ€¢Take-ðŸ’—#5349: Sure
[2021-04-15 00:55:59] (683525703425196109) ðŸ’™-Misâ€¢Take-ðŸ’—#5349: I lost a friend a few months ago to Sucide at the age of 16 and I kept telling him; "call a hotline" like several times and he won't listen he said "Nah" and "I'm done getting help" and he hasn't responded back on Google Hangouts and he died....
[2021-04-15 00:56:39] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: oh i'm sorry to hear that. that's definitely a lot to have to deal with. how are you coping with it?
[2021-04-15 00:57:11] (683525703425196109) ðŸ’™-Misâ€¢Take-ðŸ’—#5349: I can't... I just feel like I wanna join him and I have a knife to myself while crying....
[2021-04-15 00:57:40] (683525703425196109) ðŸ’™-Misâ€¢Take-ðŸ’—#5349: Sorry I had to delete it; I have trust issues
[2021-04-15 00:58:55] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i understand how difficult it is to lose someone however it doesn't mean that you have to die because of it. you can choose to honor the memories you had with him and keep living for his sake.
[2021-04-15 00:59:07] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: live the life he sadly didn't get the chance to live.
[2021-04-15 00:59:56] (683525703425196109) ðŸ’™-Misâ€¢Take-ðŸ’—#5349: It's just like I failed him.... HE WAS only 16! And I can't do this anymore... Every damn day; I look back at the messages and it's fucking with my head...
[2021-04-15 01:01:18] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: you didn't fail him. you're a kid too. you don't have to feel like you have the responsibility of someone else's life in your hands. the adults in his life should have been there for him. there was only so much you could do and you did the best you could.
[2021-04-15 01:02:04] (683525703425196109) ðŸ’™-Misâ€¢Take-ðŸ’—#5349: <a:03_NekoCry1:771987247904981012>  it's my fault and it's to much to handle atm....
[2021-04-15 01:02:16] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: why would it be your fault?
[2021-04-15 01:02:35] (683525703425196109) ðŸ’™-Misâ€¢Take-ðŸ’—#5349: I couldve saved him...
[2021-04-15 01:02:46] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: how could you saved him?
[2021-04-15 01:03:21] (683525703425196109) ðŸ’™-Misâ€¢Take-ðŸ’—#5349: If I wasn't in my fucking Depression state
[2021-04-15 01:03:45] (683525703425196109) ðŸ’™-Misâ€¢Take-ðŸ’—#5349: And it would've turned out just fine...
[2021-04-15 01:04:29] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: you don't know that. you don't know what could have happened. there's reason to guess how things could have been different. you're only going to torment yourself by doing that.
[2021-04-15 01:05:24] (683525703425196109) ðŸ’™-Misâ€¢Take-ðŸ’—#5349: I'm just emotionless, and I don't know what to feel, he made me happy and my emotions been dead ever since....
[2021-04-15 01:06:22] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: it makes sense. you're grieving his absence but once you are able to heal, things will feel better again
[2021-04-15 01:08:24] (683525703425196109) ðŸ’™-Misâ€¢Take-ðŸ’—#5349: It won't be...
[2021-04-15 01:08:49] (683525703425196109) ðŸ’™-Misâ€¢Take-ðŸ’—#5349: He was the only hope I had my emotions left... I just wish things was back to normal
[2021-04-15 01:09:38] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: but you don't know that. you're guessing what the future will be like when in reality, you have no clue what will happen. i know it's hard to feel like anything can improve but it can.
[2021-04-15 01:10:43] (683525703425196109) ðŸ’™-Misâ€¢Take-ðŸ’—#5349: Nothing will get better...
[2021-04-15 01:10:52] (683525703425196109) ðŸ’™-Misâ€¢Take-ðŸ’—#5349: That's what I keep telling myself...
[2021-04-15 01:12:39] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: sometimes we tell ourselves lies because we believe there is no way for things ever to get better but things do. otherwise there wouldn't be so many people who have survived being suicidal.
[2021-04-15 01:13:57] (683525703425196109) ðŸ’™-Misâ€¢Take-ðŸ’—#5349: I might just do it, since I lost everything...
[2021-04-15 01:14:45] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: you remember how you told me that you told your friend to call a hotline? that's what you need to do. you need to talk to a professional about this. life is worth living. there's so many things you're going to experience.
[2021-04-15 01:15:03] (683525703425196109) ðŸ’™-Misâ€¢Take-ðŸ’—#5349: I'm just gonna call my friend which is my brother
[2021-04-15 01:15:49] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: why not call a hotline?

[2021-04-15 01:22:04] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: aww there's nothing better than having a close platonic relationship with someone to the point that they feel like family
