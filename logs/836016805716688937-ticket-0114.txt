[2021-04-25 23:14:16] (775066414242463808) Pigeon Queen#3514: Hello.. I would need to talk to someone, I'm pretty lonely right now and I feel like I'm all alone.. I've been ||self harm|| free for 3 weeks now but I really want to do it. I don't have friends and I don't know how to make new ones.. I tried here but I just felt like a bother
[2021-04-25 23:15:05] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: hey! youâ€™re not a bother at all, we love having you around, the sever gets quiet sometimes and it can be really frustrating when youâ€™re feelings alone so i get that. have you tried any alternatives tonight?
[2021-04-25 23:17:21] (775066414242463808) Pigeon Queen#3514: When I suggested to talk to anyone really just to i dunno..  Just to not feel so alone and the chat just stopped writting, (I'm not blaming them I swear !!! I'm sorry I swear they have the right to do it, it just hurted my feelings..)

I'm sorry...
[2021-04-25 23:18:07] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: no itâ€™s okay, youâ€™re very valid in feelings like that
[2021-04-25 23:18:30] (775066414242463808) Pigeon Queen#3514: No.. I never found one that worked for me yet.. And this time I really want to just ||slit my wrist and just stop existing ðŸ’” ||
[2021-04-25 23:19:08] (775066414242463808) Pigeon Queen#3514: it was like highschool, when I enterred a room, it became quiet cause no one like me
[2021-04-25 23:19:23] (775066414242463808) Pigeon Queen#3514: smiles disapears.. Laughs faint away..
[2021-04-25 23:20:38] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: in here you donâ€™t need to spoiler with me itâ€™s okay.
[2021-04-25 23:21:19] (775066414242463808) Pigeon Queen#3514: the only one who stays with me is my cat and it's hard to think that he's my oonly friend

it breaks my heart
[2021-04-25 23:21:43] (775066414242463808) Pigeon Queen#3514: I don't understand humans..
[2021-04-25 23:21:58] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: cats are so loving creatures, their purr is lovely to listen to, they donâ€™t understand humans, but they still love us
[2021-04-25 23:22:52] (775066414242463808) Pigeon Queen#3514: yes they are, but after a moment, it gets really lonely when Romeo is the only one who hangs around me..
[2021-04-25 23:23:45] (775066414242463808) Pigeon Queen#3514: It helps a bit to know that he likes me enough to stay with me most of the time, but I can't really have conversations with him..
[2021-04-25 23:24:13] (775066414242463808) Pigeon Queen#3514: And if I kill myself, there is other people around the house, he'll be ok without me
[2021-04-25 23:26:26] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i really enjoy conversations with my hamster, itâ€™s comforting, she may not be able to respond or understand me, but she loves me more than anyone else in the world, much like Romeo for you,
[2021-04-25 23:27:08] (775066414242463808) Pigeon Queen#3514: yeah but.. there's like.. 7 other people in the house.. I think he will be fine
[2021-04-25 23:28:37] (775066414242463808) Pigeon Queen#3514: you know.. my "brother" is my best friend.. It's just that he's pretty distant this week and wants to be alone.. So I started to try to talk to people in different servers, but I'm not social.. I'm autistic, I don't get people
[2021-04-25 23:29:29] (775066414242463808) Pigeon Queen#3514: I don't get friendships.. That's why I'm all alone.. My brother can make best friends and become a moderator on a new server in like 5 mins
[2021-04-25 23:29:44] (775066414242463808) Pigeon Queen#3514: everyone like him.. It's the opposite for me
[2021-04-25 23:30:54] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: weâ€™re all different and thatâ€™s okay, we do things at different speeds, weâ€™re still moving and thatâ€™s good
[2021-04-25 23:32:09] (775066414242463808) Pigeon Queen#3514: it won't make a difference whrn I kill myself
[2021-04-25 23:32:20] (775066414242463808) Pigeon Queen#3514: I have to real family or friends
[2021-04-25 23:32:29] (775066414242463808) Pigeon Queen#3514: I have nothing to live for
[2021-04-25 23:32:51] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: letâ€™s take some deep breaths here
