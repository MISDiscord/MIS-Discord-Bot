[2021-04-25 22:33:58] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: my personal feelings have nothing to do with our decision to deny your application thank you, i for one have no negative or positive feelings towards you. your application was subpar to our standards, we all change and improve, you can do the same and if we see the improvements we are looking for, then you can join the team. i’m sorry about your frustration. but there is no issue with our system that has anything to do with you as a person
[2021-04-25 22:35:21] (583676874064920594) Mad llama#7674: subpar still no?
