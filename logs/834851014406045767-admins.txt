[2021-04-23 15:31:26] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: it’s an alright app but i think they’d be better as private support team since were not looking for more mods
[2021-04-23 15:31:27] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Absolutely love it

[2021-04-23 15:32:05] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I didn’t expect her to really do it either but yee
[2021-04-23 15:33:05] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: *she would make a really good mod tho*
[2021-04-23 15:33:09] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I know we aren’t looking
[2021-04-23 15:33:11] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: But
[2021-04-23 15:33:17] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: She is good mod

[2021-04-23 15:34:25] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: She would for sure she has my vote if we are looking for one
[2021-04-23 15:39:29] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: ^^^ me three
[2021-04-23 15:39:35] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Idk who two is
[2021-04-23 15:39:37] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: But yeah
[2021-04-23 15:41:53] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: plus we have a waiting period anyways, and we need to see if they’re active in the server, we’ve had some really great apps that we’ve turned down in the past that we should consider before friends
[2021-04-23 15:42:24] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: ~~plus y’all know her~~
[2021-04-23 15:44:16] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Yeah true
[2021-04-23 15:44:20] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Activity is a huge factor
[2021-04-23 15:44:29] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I’d say yes on knowing her basis and I know she’s a good person
[2021-04-23 15:44:37] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: But not activity is a instant no
[2021-04-23 15:46:04] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: it feels like nepotism if you added her without the waiting period
[2021-04-23 15:51:36] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Yeah I agree
[2021-04-23 15:52:07] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I wasn’t gunna add her I was just saying she’d be a really good mod *if* we were too
[2021-04-23 15:52:12] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: But I get your point
