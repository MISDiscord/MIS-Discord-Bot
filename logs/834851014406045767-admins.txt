[2021-04-23 15:31:26] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: it’s an alright app but i think they’d be better as private support team since were not looking for more mods
[2021-04-23 15:31:27] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Absolutely love it
[2021-04-23 15:31:38] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: <:whitewolfhehe:562392660795719717>

[2021-04-23 15:33:05] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: *she would make a really good mod tho*
[2021-04-23 15:33:09] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I know we aren’t looking

[2021-04-23 15:41:53] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: plus we have a waiting period anyways, and we need to see if they’re active in the server, we’ve had some really great apps that we’ve turned down in the past that we should consider before friends
[2021-04-23 15:42:24] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: ~~plus y’all know her~~
[2021-04-23 15:44:16] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Yeah true
[2021-04-23 15:44:20] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Activity is a huge factor
[2021-04-23 15:44:29] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I’d say yes on knowing her basis and I know she’s a good person
[2021-04-23 15:44:37] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: But not activity is a instant no
[2021-04-23 15:46:04] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: it feels like nepotism if you added her without the waiting period
[2021-04-23 15:51:36] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Yeah I agree
[2021-04-23 15:52:07] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I wasn’t gunna add her I was just saying she’d be a really good mod *if* we were too
[2021-04-23 15:52:12] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: But I get your point
[2021-04-24 16:55:02] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: <@!516313738588979210> sorry thought it best to move over here

[2021-04-24 16:55:38] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i haven’t really seen them do mod stuff
[2021-04-24 16:55:44] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: Em deffo has been trying where they can
[2021-04-24 16:55:48] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: but star not so much
[2021-04-24 16:56:09] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: which is why i don’t think i’m going to support the promotion when their trial ends
[2021-04-24 16:56:13] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: and i’m iffy about em
[2021-04-24 16:56:34] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Yeah I think either we need to extend stars period
[2021-04-24 16:56:44] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I’m liking em’s work though
[2021-04-24 16:56:48] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Not too much modding
[2021-04-24 16:56:53] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: But us mods are really quick
[2021-04-24 16:57:02] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: So maybe we need to include Em more?
[2021-04-24 16:57:10] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I never seen star here much to be honest
[2021-04-24 16:57:28] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: yeah which why i don’t think extending is a great idea
[2021-04-24 16:57:36] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i agree we are super quick tho
[2021-04-24 16:57:47] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: you could try testing him?
[2021-04-24 16:57:53] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: star?

[2021-04-24 16:59:31] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I think I’ve confused myself

[2021-04-24 17:04:33] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: don’t worry i should have specify
[2021-04-24 17:04:56] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: you could set up a training simulation
[2021-04-24 17:05:01] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: or try real time testing
[2021-04-24 17:05:17] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I’d like to do real time testing
[2021-04-24 17:05:28] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: To see how they react to the pressure
[2021-04-24 17:06:23] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: good luck!
[2021-04-24 17:06:55] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: me?

[2021-04-24 17:12:11] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: -poll Requirements Activity "Been on the Mod more than x months" "DMs Open" "Able to Answer Modding related questions"
[2021-04-24 17:12:29] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Shouldn’t they be all of them lol
[2021-04-24 17:12:50] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: shh I haven’t finished
[2021-04-24 17:13:18] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i personally don’t have my dms on open so i don’t get messages from normal users, from mods they can message me whenever
[2021-04-24 17:14:09] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: -poll "If you have voted for been on the server x amount of times what do amount do want? (In months)" 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
[2021-04-24 17:14:30] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Oops bad grammar

[2021-04-24 17:18:56] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: -remind 3h check on poll results <@&793917061243994134>
[2021-04-24 20:20:05] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: <@&793917061243994134>

[2021-04-24 20:20:35] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: okie
[2021-04-24 20:20:36] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: so
[2021-04-24 20:21:12] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Analysing the poll results makes it at we do want mod mentors
[2021-04-24 20:21:44] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: the factors of getting these mod mentors are activity, open dms and able to answer mod related questions
[2021-04-24 20:22:08] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: for the time on the mod team question
[2021-04-24 20:22:33] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: we have 2 for 3 months 
1 for 4 months 
1 for 5 months
[2021-04-24 20:23:03] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: so if we were to go for the first option because it has the most people
[2021-04-24 20:23:25] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: the options for mod mentors would be me, bee, Michael
[2021-04-24 20:23:44] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: and I think kai and noods might be a little late for this draw I’m not sure thought
[2021-04-24 20:25:16] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: _uhh can i withdraw my name pls_
[2021-04-24 20:25:54] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: *why*
[2021-04-24 20:26:40] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: upon reflection i wouldn’t be a great fit for it
[2021-04-24 20:26:55] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: May I ask why you think so?
[2021-04-24 20:27:10] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: so it would be michael and lily then?
[2021-04-24 20:28:22] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: In the nicest way possible
[2021-04-24 20:28:30] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: *please don’t get offended michael*
[2021-04-24 20:28:41] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: but Michael does more tech
[2021-04-24 20:28:48] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: So we’d have to lower the limit
[2021-04-24 20:29:25] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i think due to everything i just wouldn’t be good at it, i think they’d be more problems created by me
[2021-04-24 20:29:29] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: which would mean it would just go down a trial group making noods and kai available to be mentors
[2021-04-24 20:29:44] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I don’t think you’d cause problems at all?
[2021-04-24 20:30:20] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: I don’t think we should have a set time requirement I have an idea to make this easier
[2021-04-24 20:30:48] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Also I didn’t mean you were a bad mod with this btw
[2021-04-24 20:30:57] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: mod death match
[2021-04-24 20:31:00] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Lol it’s okie
[2021-04-24 20:31:22] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: You’re not wrong about it, I don’t have the time to be a “real” mod which is why I’ve always done tech stuff
[2021-04-24 20:31:30] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I guess me and Michael could do mod mentors interviews?
[2021-04-24 20:31:37] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Can I say my idea
[2021-04-24 20:31:43] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Nah you are a real mod you are just techy
[2021-04-24 20:31:48] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: *yeah I was waiting for it*
[2021-04-24 20:31:54] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I’m just throwing ideas out
[2021-04-24 20:31:54] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Okie lol
[2021-04-24 20:32:04] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yes tell us your sweet whispers
[2021-04-24 20:32:13] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: uwu asmr
[2021-04-24 20:32:15] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Anyway
[2021-04-24 20:32:26] (821012679816249424) The Library Collective#0001: i thought that was your idea for a moment
[2021-04-24 20:32:33] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: So I know we talked about the idea of having like trial mod/mod/senior mod before
[2021-04-24 20:32:48] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: asmr mentor
[2021-04-24 20:32:58] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Shut up and let me talk smh
[2021-04-24 20:33:57] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: And we weren’t sure because we didn’t know how to actually determine who got to be senior mod and when
[2021-04-24 20:34:37] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: So when new people join the team and choose mentors I think that’s a good and simple way to choose because it also is like the “next level” of experience once you start teaching people too
[2021-04-24 20:34:55] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: So basically senior mods are just people with mentees
[2021-04-24 20:35:02] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Yeah but the point of mentor was to have a point of authority because we are shit without structure
[2021-04-24 20:35:05] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: This idea sounded better and made more sense in mt head
[2021-04-24 20:35:22] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Wait my brain typed that wrong
[2021-04-24 20:35:38] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: ~~wouldn’t that make lily and michael the only ones who can mentor~~
[2021-04-24 20:35:38] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Yes this would provide more structure
[2021-04-24 20:35:51] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: no no I didn’t explain it well
[2021-04-24 20:35:54] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: yeah *which is what I’m not getting*
[2021-04-24 20:36:08] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: So like
[2021-04-24 20:36:15] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: You mean mentors = senior mods?
[2021-04-24 20:36:27] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: So if we pick mentors they get a snazzy upgrade
[2021-04-24 20:36:31] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: New mods can choose any full moderator they want to be their mentor
[2021-04-24 20:36:33] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Yes yes
[2021-04-24 20:36:38] (821012679816249424) The Library Collective#0001: so like new person comes onto the team, pick their mentor and they get promoted to sr mod?
[2021-04-24 20:36:45] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Exactly
[2021-04-24 20:36:53] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: But-
[2021-04-24 20:37:02] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: *what*
[2021-04-24 20:37:08] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: so basically the new people choose who gets to be senior mod
[2021-04-24 20:37:11] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: No ok like let me explain lol
[2021-04-24 20:37:13] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: but what if they pick someone who isn’t in the same time zone or isn’t there when they are on
[2021-04-24 20:37:14] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: *wait what?*
[2021-04-24 20:37:15] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Not quite
[2021-04-24 20:37:18] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Ahh
[2021-04-24 20:37:30] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Nvm I’m not explaining this well you guys are misunderstanding lol
[2021-04-24 20:37:47] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Do you mean like we pick mentors and they get senior mod?
[2021-04-24 20:38:30] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: No ok so basically right now trial mod is only here cause we want to see how new people do first right
[2021-04-24 20:38:39] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: So then there’s just mod after that
[2021-04-24 20:38:56] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: oh youre saying mentor is the next level
[2021-04-24 20:39:07] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: below senior mod but above mod?
[2021-04-24 20:39:18] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: so you wanna add another level?
[2021-04-24 20:39:54] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: haha mentor mods. we can call them m&m a
[2021-04-24 20:39:54] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: WAIT idea
[2021-04-24 20:40:06] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: mm
[2021-04-24 20:40:09] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: i like this
[2021-04-24 20:40:21] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: why don’t you just bump me and Michael’s role up 
and give mod mentors mods senior mods role 
And so and so
[2021-04-24 20:40:25] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Yes so basically we promote people to senior mod when we feel they’ve had enough experience and been on the team for longer and when new people join the team they pick from senior mods because it’s best to learn from people that have experience
[2021-04-24 20:40:37] (821012679816249424) The Library Collective#0001: ohhhh
[2021-04-24 20:40:37] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: That’s what I’m saying lol

[2021-04-24 20:41:48] (821012679816249424) The Library Collective#0001: but do lily and michael get a new role and mentors are sr mods or do we just make a mentor role
[2021-04-24 20:42:00] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i think we should make a mentor role
[2021-04-24 20:42:04] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Ok let me explain again please
[2021-04-24 20:42:04] (821012679816249424) The Library Collective#0001: yeah same
[2021-04-24 20:42:09] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Okie

[2021-04-24 20:42:14] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: You guys confuse me when chat it being spammed
[2021-04-24 20:42:14] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: everyone shut up and let michael talk
[2021-04-24 20:42:20] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: ^ please
[2021-04-24 20:42:51] (533736043736858627) yxng_pxriah#1969: *michael say something*
[2021-04-24 20:42:54] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Kai stfu
[2021-04-24 20:43:46] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: So we had talked about in the past how we wanted to possibly make another mod role or do something to make the team a bit more structured
[2021-04-24 20:44:02] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: So my idea was adding senior mods and implementing it with the idea of mentors
[2021-04-24 20:44:28] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: ~~not stealing this from my old job~~ but ngl it worked really really well if it’s done right and people understand it
[2021-04-24 20:45:11] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: So lily and I still have separate roles as owners/managers/bitches whatever we want to call it
[2021-04-24 20:45:21] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Then there’s 3 levels of mod
[2021-04-24 20:46:12] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Trial is just to see how they do and make sure they still do well in real situations, if they pass that period they’re promoted to full mod which is the same as the full mod we have now
[2021-04-24 20:47:22] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Now senior mod has no set timeline or criteria, we can choose to either vote on it or lily and I will just pick it’s up to you guys what you think is best. Ideally with a balanced team there’s slightly less senior mods than full mods otherwise it defeats the purpose and we’re just back to where we are now so it works better for when our team gets bigger
[2021-04-24 20:49:37] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Senior mods are just to kind of indicate they’ve been here for a significant amount of time which means experience which is good. They’re sort of like “team captains” but not idk, just like easy way for new mods to identify good people to go to about advice if they want, but we should still be encouraged to just ask questions in general mod chat anyway
[2021-04-24 20:51:04] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: And when new mods get promoted they choose a mentor for senior mods that want to participate, it’s optional to take on mentees, and then those that senior mod is responsible for kind of being a “go to person” for the mentee to ask for help if they’re still a bit shy or just want to work together, to build a better connection between team members if that makes sense
[2021-04-24 20:51:47] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Mentors are just like a guide and also responsible for checking in to see how they’re doing
[2021-04-24 20:52:33] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: This also helps us, hopefully this will never happen, but if there’s a problem with a mod, they have a mentor that knows them well that we can talk to to ask how to approach them best and what they think we should do
[2021-04-24 20:52:41] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Idk if this is making a ton of sense
[2021-04-24 20:52:45] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Think of it like
[2021-04-24 20:54:48] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: I actually can’t think of a good analogy lol I was gonna use a Star Wars joke but lily would slap me if I did that
[2021-04-24 20:55:11] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Anyway sorry that was long lmk what questions you guys have and this is just an idea too lol it might not be the best idea
[2021-04-24 20:56:04] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I like it!
[2021-04-24 20:57:02] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: And for role clarification yes it’ll be a new sr mod role and lily and I’s will change
[2021-04-24 20:57:29] (821012679816249424) The Library Collective#0001: ah okay that what was i was gonna about

[2021-04-24 20:58:47] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I feel like though if we were going to do mod mentors me and Michael should do the interviews to keep the policy consistent
[2021-04-24 20:59:05] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: Yeah that’s fair
[2021-04-24 20:59:15] (222479899808628736) Michael#3287: So would we be deciding who is?
[2021-04-24 20:59:18] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Yeah

[2021-04-28 06:02:52] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I think adding more mods kinda helps, I think we’re a big enough to add a bunch more imo. But I don’t wanna add just for the sake of adding I wanna add people that will benefit all of us and the server. Tbh, I think we have more team members in the other server I mod in at this point than here and here is twice the size
[2021-04-28 06:03:28] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Quality over quantity
[2021-04-28 06:03:30] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Also
[2021-04-28 06:03:31] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: I think it’ll benefit the people that feel a little stressed, I think it’ll give more eyes on problems more at once, more thoughts and minds going into decisions and things
[2021-04-28 06:03:54] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: *also also i want to say vefore its too late i dont think we need more event team people*

[2021-04-28 06:10:23] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: <@516313738588979210> i think its coz events itself is an announcement channel
[2021-04-28 06:10:41] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Lemme try again

[2021-04-28 06:27:49] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: unpopular opinion time
[2021-04-28 06:28:14] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i don’t think we should be giving trial mods access to intel/ solicitude servers until they’re full mod
[2021-04-28 06:28:20] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: it just makes it awk if they don’t get it
[2021-04-28 06:28:48] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i also think ems trial should be extended
[2021-04-28 06:29:52] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: main reasoning is that i don’t think they’ve shown enough confidence in both modding and opinions to have the full responsibility
[2021-04-28 06:30:04] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i think they need more time to be able to grow comfortably
[2021-04-28 06:32:25] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Ye ye!
[2021-04-28 06:32:29] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Sorry
[2021-04-28 06:32:32] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: But yeah
[2021-04-28 06:32:36] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I agree
[2021-04-28 06:33:20] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: It’s not an unpopular opinion :)
[2021-04-28 06:33:36] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: we're not promoting star correct?
[2021-04-28 06:33:57] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: poll said no
[2021-04-28 06:34:10] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: yeah then we do need at least one more mod
[2021-04-28 06:34:32] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: I like Amanda’s
[2021-04-28 06:34:57] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: i haven't read hers
[2021-04-28 06:35:03] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: amanda in herself isn’t too confident
[2021-04-28 06:35:04] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: ill read it later after school
[2021-04-28 06:35:14] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: We can work on that though
[2021-04-28 06:35:16] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Together
[2021-04-28 06:35:40] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: she messages me after support tickets wondering how she’s done because she’s worried she did something wrong
[2021-04-28 06:35:47] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: which i don’t mind i will always encourage people
[2021-04-28 06:36:00] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: but i don’t think it would be possible for the mod team
[2021-04-28 06:36:01] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: maybe we could work on confidence together?
[2021-04-28 06:36:40] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: it would take a lot to fixx that
[2021-04-28 06:37:10] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: the is some other great apps we can all look over together on sunday

[2021-04-28 06:37:24] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: i’m already making a list of what we’re doing
[2021-04-28 06:37:24] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: YES
[2021-04-28 06:37:38] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: my topic are back

[2021-04-28 06:37:51] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: So we need to stay on track
[2021-04-28 06:37:58] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: no chitter chatter then

[2021-04-28 06:38:17] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: good
[2021-04-28 06:40:01] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: If we need to go over an hour I’ll go muted
[2021-04-28 14:13:14] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: So the general consensus is

- Emeri is going to be the only mod but we think they need a longer trial period 

- We’d like to add more mods 

- And if we add new mods we’d like 2
[2021-04-28 14:18:07] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: sounds about right
[2021-04-28 20:04:35] (821012679816249424) The Library Collective#6969: yeah pretty much

[2021-04-29 14:03:52] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: so its not like they were confused about that
[2021-04-29 14:06:19] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: they have opened a private support app at least 5 times now
[2021-04-29 14:07:44] (543871424188907544) awesomenoodles#4169: oh wait a support app
