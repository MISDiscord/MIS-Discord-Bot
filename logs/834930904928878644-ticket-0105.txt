[2021-04-22 23:20:32] (827930081040662539) Ashy#8762: Ok! I'm fine with no spoilers
[2021-04-22 23:21:18] (827930081040662539) Ashy#8762: I just kind of feel lost in life right now.
[2021-04-22 23:22:55] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: mhms, understandable
[2021-04-22 23:23:13] (827930081040662539) Ashy#8762: I'm questioning sexuality, get bullied for being non-binary, no services can help me because of COVID, i feel my dada dislikes me more everyday and feel tired everyday. Plus, i have anxiety and depression.
[2021-04-22 23:23:27] (827930081040662539) Ashy#8762: Dad*
[2021-04-22 23:25:53] (827930081040662539) Ashy#8762: And I have no one to talk to all day because my mom is at work all day and I am in remote school.
[2021-04-22 23:27:34] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: mhms, well first things first, your gender identity is very valid, i’m so sorry for what you are going through with that, but you are valid. next, nothing is wrong with questioning your sexuality, just like gender it’s a fluid, it changes with time and as you start to age you’ll learn more about what you like and what you don’t. for help outside of COVID i recommend looking into online resources, for example, in Canada (where i live) there is a kids help phone/online service, if possible i suggest looking into that. Parents are difficult, if i can offer any advice is to not let them get to you, if possible focus on yourself, when you better yourself and focus on doing right by you, the rest slowly comes to place. 

i’m very happy you found this server! everyone here is really nice and i hope it will help to make you feel less alone
[2021-04-22 23:29:45] (827930081040662539) Ashy#8762: I just still don't feel like my dad even likes me anymore. I don't know if it's because I'm slow at math and reading, or if it's because I'm non-binary.
[2021-04-22 23:33:36] (827930081040662539) Ashy#8762: I'm always thinking about my sister too. When we were in grade 2-ish everyday she would say "I hate you" until grade 5-ish and she just stopped after that, and I'm concerned for her. She always stays in her room until dinner, never talks to me, and if she did, it would just be like "oh can you walk the dog?" And she is always across from me at school on the yard (when we were hybrid) and when i went to her she would run with her friends.
[2021-04-22 23:33:53] (827930081040662539) Ashy#8762: I'm scared if I'm the problem or if she is.
[2021-04-22 23:34:05] (827930081040662539) Ashy#8762: And I'm scared for her mental health.
[2021-04-22 23:35:43] (827930081040662539) Ashy#8762: And my dad. He has been battling his mom's death and has been struggling with his small business.
[2021-04-22 23:36:32] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: mhms, i hear you, in my personal opinion only mental harm will come from trying to figure out how someone might not like you, the only thing that matters is how you feel. as for your sister, sometimes people need space, sometimes the most you can do is let them know you are there for them. i also just want to say it’s unlikely either of you are “the problem” sometimes theres just a problem and people who are affected in different ways.
[2021-04-22 23:38:07] (827930081040662539) Ashy#8762: I just don't feel liked or loved by anyone on this earth. I'm wondering if I shold even be here living.
[2021-04-22 23:38:35] (827930081040662539) Ashy#8762: And I don't have any friends.
[2021-04-22 23:39:48] (686421206680731649) 𝚎𝚖𝚎𝚛𝚒#5346: of course you should, life is about finding yourself and those people! for example here is a safe place, there are tons of people you could easily become friends with, real life is a little harder but it’ll come in time too, it’s cliche but true don’t give up :3
[2021-04-22 23:40:33] (827930081040662539) Ashy#8762: Sorry I have to go have a shower.
[2021-04-22 23:41:25] (827930081040662539) Ashy#8762: But I am thankful for you taking time from your day and giving me advice.
