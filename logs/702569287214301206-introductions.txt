[2021-04-09 14:09:19] (655996656902340609) Bríana#1483: Hello.  My name is Bríana.  But I also answer to, and am okay with Bría.  My pronouns are she/her/hers.  I am a 43 year old trans woman, married, and a parent of 5, and I live in the US.  I have an extensive trauma background, and do contend with PTSD, anxiety, depression and occasional dissociation.  Until recently I have been crisis support, and a little further back I have also been an SA advocate.  Presently I am finishing my bachelors degree's in psychology, sociology and history.  I will be proceeding further into psychology with the end goal being a clinical psychologist with a small pit-stop of earning my master in clinical counseling.  I am also a "young" trans historian.

My name's Mich. I don't have a diagnosis for anything but, I'm often very depressed and I get a lot of anxiety-inducing intrusive thoughts. I don't relate well to others and I have a terrible time with verbal communication. 
On a lighter note, I like to game, paint/draw, compose music, and write almost anything (movie/TV scripts, comedy sketches, graphic novel scripts, short stories, etc.). However, I have A LOT of unfinished projects; I have a hard time finishing things before I get fixated on a new idea 😅. I identify as genderfluid so my pronouns change often. And...
I think that's it
