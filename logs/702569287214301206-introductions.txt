[2021-04-09 14:09:19] (655996656902340609) Bríana#1483: Hello.  My name is Bríana.  But I also answer to, and am okay with Bría.  My pronouns are she/her/hers.  I am a 43 year old trans woman, married, and a parent of 5, and I live in the US.  I have an extensive trauma background, and do contend with PTSD, anxiety, depression and occasional dissociation.  Until recently I have been crisis support, and a little further back I have also been an SA advocate.  Presently I am finishing my bachelors degree's in psychology, sociology and history.  I will be proceeding further into psychology with the end goal being a clinical psychologist with a small pit-stop of earning my master in clinical counseling.  I am also a "young" trans historian.

I have MASS anxiety, depression and I'm also dyslectic ( If I spelt it wrong please point it out, I try my best but I'm awful at writing / spelling ).
I don't have many friends and I get pretty sad pretty often.
I live in United Kingdom far out of London.
Dm's are open all the time as to I like talking to people.
