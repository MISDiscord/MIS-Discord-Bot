[2021-04-09 14:09:19] (655996656902340609) Bríana#1483: Hello.  My name is Bríana.  But I also answer to, and am okay with Bría.  My pronouns are she/her/hers.  I am a 43 year old trans woman, married, and a parent of 5, and I live in the US.  I have an extensive trauma background, and do contend with PTSD, anxiety, depression and occasional dissociation.  Until recently I have been crisis support, and a little further back I have also been an SA advocate.  Presently I am finishing my bachelors degree's in psychology, sociology and history.  I will be proceeding further into psychology with the end goal being a clinical psychologist with a small pit-stop of earning my master in clinical counseling.  I am also a "young" trans historian.

My name's Mich. I don't have a diagnosis for anything but, I'm often very depressed and I get a lot of anxiety-inducing intrusive thoughts. I don't relate well to others and I have a terrible time with verbal communication. 
On a lighter note, I like to game, paint/draw, compose music, and write almost anything (movie/TV scripts, comedy sketches, graphic novel scripts, short stories, etc.). However, I have A LOT of unfinished projects; I have a hard time finishing things before I get fixated on a new idea 😅. I identify as genderfluid so my pronouns change often. And...
I think that's it

I find myself , at times , hopeless and without any motivation. I haven't actually been diagnosed and won't make as if I was but I do find myself leaning a bit to anxiety. Waking up with nausea and sometimes just losing my mind. Skip days when I have too much stress and sometimes I don't feel real. I can't be sure as I'm still a teen so 'mood swings' is probably just is what it is when it comes to being happy and then quickly sad. I play games , I write (poetry/novel) , I like learning code/tech/biology/history/psychology. On a rare day I read.

I'm just looking for a group for support as I work through my regular struggles with ADHD/Anxiety & Depression. I have a very treatment resistant style of depression that has been particularly heinous as of late. I work from home running an Amazon shop. Over the last few years I have dealt with losing my father who was only 65, and during that time I also separated and got divorced from who was once my best friend/wife. She ghosted me and I did not get much closure there and that interrupted the grieving process with my dad passing. Lately I've found myself more reclusive and am making an effort to reach out and gain support for like-minds as well as general friendship and connection. Hope you are all well, good day, PEACE!
