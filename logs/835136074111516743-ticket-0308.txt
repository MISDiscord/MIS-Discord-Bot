I assure you support and love and care is always going to be given here
[2021-04-23 12:58:30] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: As we always do:)
[2021-04-23 12:59:43] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Is there anything else in the ticket you wanna talk about or should I close ?
[2021-04-23 13:00:04] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Feel free to close, just making sure other people know they're not doing well.
[2021-04-23 13:00:16] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: They're off to hospital so they will be getting help.
[2021-04-23 13:02:58] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Yeah of course and I appreciate you letting us know too. It’s always good to know these things when they ask for support as well. It is definitely unfortunate, and respectfully of course, ultimately they are the ones that decide how they get the help they need too in these scenarios but it’s a good thing they’re seeking help for this
[2021-04-23 13:17:38] (200391976837840896) ParanoidKitty#0081: Hey I’m gonna close ticket you said it’s ok right!:)
