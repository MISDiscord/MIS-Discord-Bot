[2021-04-11 06:13:45] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Used to think everyone had an internal world, that everyone personified their different brain processes.
[2021-04-11 06:30:58] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Actually, we have a really good example which has nothing to do with mental health, but actually the physical differences in our eyes. Because we have such a strong prescription the lenses we require refract different wavelengths of light at different angles. Red and blue light are the most noticeably shifted towards acute and oblique angles respectively. We fundamentally cannot see coloured object in the way that most other people do because of this.

[2021-04-17 13:25:13] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: teal-heya!
[2021-04-17 13:25:29] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: first time i remembered my proxy correctly oops
[2021-04-17 13:27:21] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: we normally have ap on front so i don’t even remember what my proxy is lol.
[2021-04-17 13:27:47] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: oh yeah thats smart but we don't log our switches with pk lol
[2021-04-17 13:28:40] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: we normally do for organization, with so many people it’s near impossible to keep track of who fronted when without logging it somewhere, and pk’s been the most efficient so far.
[2021-04-17 13:29:38] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: oh yeah thats fair, we used simply plural for a while but nobody remembered to log stuff so it was pretty much useless haha
[2021-04-17 13:29:52] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: that’s an app, right?
[2021-04-17 13:29:58] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: yup!
[2021-04-17 13:30:15] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: yeah, i think we looked at it but isnt available for ios yet or something like that.
[2021-04-17 13:30:22] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: does it work well at least?
[2021-04-17 13:30:44] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: it works like a charm, if you actually remember to use it xd
[2021-04-17 13:31:08] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: haha makes sense. it might be a pain to remember to log switches both there and on pk though-
[2021-04-17 13:31:16] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: you can even set up polls and stuff there
[2021-04-17 13:31:23] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: oh yeah xd
[2021-04-17 13:31:48] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: ooh, that sounds cool.
[2021-04-17 13:32:23] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: i guess we probably couldn’t get it though, parental controls on our phone mean any app has to be run by our parents first, and i’m not quite sure how we’d explain that one.
[2021-04-17 13:32:56] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: oh yikes, yeah, that might be difficult
[2021-04-17 13:34:14] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: we’ve tried to look for apps that aren’t necessarily Made for systems but can still function for them, someone found a journal app a little while ago and messed with the settings to be able to log who’s fronting. /pos
[2021-04-17 13:38:02] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: ohh yeah thats a good idea! we know a couple systems that use one of those apps where you can put your moods for the day as coloured pixels and then every alter would have their own colour, only really works for small systems since you can only have 5 and need to pay for more and i think you can only log for the whole day
[2021-04-17 13:39:01] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: we have a similar one that lets you add activities? and we haven’t seen a limit on activities so far so we’ve been using people’s names as “activities” to log who fronts, and then we can filter the journal entries by fronter and see stats and things like that.
[2021-04-17 13:39:42] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: oh thats smart! yeah, you gotta dig a little to find stuff that works but if you're determined enough xD
[2021-04-17 13:56:20] (776545200741941248) crow system#6180: I wants littles friends -zane
[2021-04-17 13:57:07] (776545200741941248) crow system#6180: So if any systems has littles
[2021-04-17 13:59:48] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: i think most systems do.
[2021-04-17 14:01:20] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Do they? We don't have any littles.
[2021-04-17 14:02:05] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: from my experience most do, but not all of course.
[2021-04-17 14:02:30] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: yup, most bigger systems do tbh
[2021-04-17 14:03:18] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: i think even when we only knew of a few people we had two littles, it’s just dependent on the system, but i think littles are generally a pretty common age group to have in-system.
[2021-04-17 14:04:05] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: yeah, we have one who is a little or a middle depending on your definition of it but then again we only have 4 alters
[2021-04-17 14:04:09] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Ah, we don't age slide at all. We're all the same age, more or less, excluding those who hold memories of other lives.
[2021-04-17 14:04:42] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: we have from infant to literally old as time, so we’re pretty spread out.
[2021-04-17 14:06:18] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Do you have non-human alters?
[2021-04-17 14:06:57] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: plenty.
[2021-04-17 14:07:13] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: i myself am non-human.
[2021-04-17 14:07:38] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We have 2, both are humanoid though.
[2021-04-17 14:08:36] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: i’m humanoid, but not all our non-humans are.
[2021-04-17 14:08:58] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Is it distressing for them when they are fronting?
[2021-04-17 14:10:09] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: sometimes. depends on who it is, i believe.
[2021-04-17 14:12:36] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: One of ours used to get very upset when they first became aware that they were in 'the wrong body'
[2021-04-17 14:13:22] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: yeah, it’s certainly distressing for some people. i’m now the host of a subsystem, so i’m quite used to a body that doesn’t look like mine lol.
[2021-04-17 14:14:06] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Yeah, we are ok with it now. Transitioning made things better for us. Makes the body feel more like our own.
[2021-04-17 14:15:04] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: yeah, we’re in a tough spot with that because we have people who present fem masc neutral and everywhere in between.
[2021-04-17 14:16:11] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: That can be hard. We are lucky that mostly our parts don't care too much about gender or are femme leaning, so our non-binary presentation works for all of us.
[2021-04-17 14:17:25] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: being neutral in presentation would probably work out the best, but i don’t think we’d want to do anything permanent.
[2021-04-17 14:23:34] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We don't usually talk about system stuff. It's all sort of new to us and some parts are having a very difficult time accepting it.
[2021-04-17 14:27:49] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: makes sense. we’ve been what- talking about it? public about it? at least on certain servers anyway, for about a year now so most people are comfortable.
[2021-04-17 14:30:04] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: We have been sort of tip-toeing around the idea for a long time without realizing it. It wasn't until a couple months ago where we sort of had a reckoning and it all came out.
[2021-04-17 14:31:47] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: i think the previous host tip tied around it for about a year and a half before other people started fronting.
[2021-04-17 14:51:49] (732879948645269586) Skylurk#4349: i just switched out for a couple minutes and came back to a powerade bottle filled with juice. huh.

Your emotions are still valid though, so you know, it's ok to be mad about people not understanding your differences.

[2021-04-28 19:52:50] (705498881089339413) VirtualAnxiety#9195: question- when adding an alter to the pluralkit stuff do you put all of their info into their name?
[2021-04-28 19:53:18] (705498881089339413) VirtualAnxiety#9195: for example when i say pk  ; member new do i put their indoe after new? -Ash
[2021-04-28 19:53:40] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: You can, but there is an option to write descriptions.
[2021-04-28 19:54:36] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -I purposefully don give much information about me, but yes, there is a description option.-

[2021-04-28 20:00:10] (705498881089339413) VirtualAnxiety#9195: when adding photos to the pk bot for each member does the photo need to be made by us or can we use photos off of websites like Pinterest as long as nobody in our system takes ownership for the artwork? -Astrid
[2021-04-28 20:06:39] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: Everything you want.
[2021-04-28 20:06:49] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: Like me, for example.
[2021-04-28 20:06:54] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: My bot:

[2021-04-28 20:08:06] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: It's fine! 🙂
[2021-04-28 20:09:26] (705498881089339413) VirtualAnxiety#9195: **Currently testing the pk, no actual responses needed**
[2021-04-28 20:09:32] (705498881089339413) VirtualAnxiety#9195: Silus: Hi
[2021-04-28 20:10:18] (705498881089339413) VirtualAnxiety#9195: pk;Silus
[2021-04-28 20:11:03] (705498881089339413) VirtualAnxiety#9195: scratch that, now i gotta figure out how to understand the whole switching between 'bots' -Astrid
[2021-04-28 20:13:51] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: You can do it.
[2021-04-28 20:14:26] (705498881089339413) VirtualAnxiety#9195: Ha, thank you very much for the motivation -Astrid
[2021-04-28 20:27:20] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: No problem 🙂
[2021-04-28 20:28:33] (705498881089339413) VirtualAnxiety#9195: So I have the members of our system that will be mainly be the ones talking, if they do, but how do each of us switch between the 'bots'? -Astrid
[2021-04-28 20:28:51] (705498881089339413) VirtualAnxiety#9195: is it the pk; switch one?
[2021-04-28 20:29:23] (821012679816249424) The Library Collective#6969: there's multiple ways, you can either log your switches with pk and set it to proxy as whoever is set as fronting or you can assign everyone an individual proxy to send with their message
[2021-04-28 20:30:23] (705498881089339413) VirtualAnxiety#9195: is that the one with the brackets? where you set each person their own set so that whenever a person types with those brackets it says it as the bot? -Astrid
[2021-04-28 20:31:00] (821012679816249424) The Library Collective#6969: mhm for example! so the proxy for this account is `?text`, so if i put a ? in front of my message it proxies as that
[2021-04-28 20:31:20] (821012679816249424) The Library Collective#6969: it does without it right now too, because i have it set to keep proxying with the most recent one
[2021-04-28 20:31:46] (821012679816249424) The Library Collective#6969: but if i want to switch, i just put whatever proxy is assigned to that pk account
[2021-04-28 20:32:41] (705498881089339413) VirtualAnxiety#9195: alright, let me try it out 🙂 -Astrid
[2021-04-28 20:33:00] (821012679816249424) The Library Collective#6969: alright! lmk if you need help with the commands ^^
