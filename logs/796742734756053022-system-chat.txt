[2021-04-11 05:37:20] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: I legit just gave this whole college level lecture in a rp group aslkdfjaslkdjf

[2021-04-11 06:07:59] (443130730478960670) Alora ðŸ¥©#7138: A site we used to help understand DID and OSDD was https://did-research.org/.

[2021-04-11 06:09:25] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: I assume people are like me a lot and don't like looking through websites
[2021-04-11 06:10:00] (609434268149743626) Ursa Major System#4025: I may have a bad attention span, don't care enough, or just plain lazy. but because I appreciate people laying out info with a direct Q&A, that's what I end up doing for everyone else
[2021-04-11 06:13:17] (443130730478960670) Alora ðŸ¥©#7138: There is a pretty large variety when it comes to mental health issues. Assuming everyone experiences it like you can blind you to exactly where the issues lie, in our experience.
[2021-04-11 06:13:45] (443130730478960670) Alora ðŸ¥©#7138: Used to think everyone had an internal world, that everyone personified their different brain processes.
[2021-04-11 06:30:58] (443130730478960670) Alora ðŸ¥©#7138: Actually, we have a really good example which has nothing to do with mental health, but actually the physical differences in our eyes. Because we have such a strong prescription the lenses we require refract different wavelengths of light at different angles. Red and blue light are the most noticeably shifted towards acute and oblique angles respectively. We fundamentally cannot see coloured object in the way that most other people do because of this.
