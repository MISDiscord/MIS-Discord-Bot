[2021-04-27 15:02:24] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: please refrain from pinging individual mods
[2021-04-27 15:02:26] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: how can i help
[2021-04-27 15:04:35] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: <@792034419858735145>
[2021-04-27 15:05:53] (792034419858735145) nug#3411: Okay
[2021-04-27 15:06:06] (792034419858735145) nug#3411: So um about my mute what was it for
[2021-04-27 15:06:51] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: as said in the reason for the mute, inappropriate behaviour in light general, talking about triggering topics so openly
[2021-04-27 15:07:13] (792034419858735145) nug#3411: Noose?
[2021-04-27 15:07:39] (792034419858735145) nug#3411: A noose is to hold things not your neck
[2021-04-27 15:08:30] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: mentioning a noose is a triggering topic due to the connotations so easily associated with the word.
[2021-04-27 15:08:39] (792034419858735145) nug#3411: I'm wasnt talking about a hangman's noose
[2021-04-27 15:09:02] (792034419858735145) nug#3411: I wasnt*
[2021-04-27 15:09:12] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: you still cannot talk about any noose’s in light general
[2021-04-27 15:09:18] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: you also asking if you could be racist here
[2021-04-27 15:09:26] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: so openly in light general
[2021-04-27 15:09:30] (792034419858735145) nug#3411: But 11 hours is a little extreme
[2021-04-27 15:09:46] (792034419858735145) nug#3411: I was wondering
[2021-04-27 15:09:57] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: it’s our system. 4 strikes is a 12 hour mute
[2021-04-27 15:10:04] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: why would you think it’s okay to be racist?
[2021-04-27 15:10:12] (792034419858735145) nug#3411: I'm not racist
[2021-04-27 15:10:22] (792034419858735145) nug#3411: I didnt say its okay
[2021-04-27 15:11:11] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: give me a second and i’ll grab the ss
[2021-04-27 15:13:21] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: you asked if it was okay to be racist here
[2021-04-27 15:13:41] (792034419858735145) nug#3411: was wondering if someone would say yes
[2021-04-27 15:13:54] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: why???
[2021-04-27 15:14:01] (792034419858735145) nug#3411: wondering

[2021-04-27 15:14:30] (792034419858735145) nug#3411: racist?
[2021-04-27 15:14:35] (792034419858735145) nug#3411: is that a trigger
[2021-04-27 15:14:50] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: if you read the rules you will clearly se anything to do with racism has to be in spoilers and spoilered topic are not allowed in light
[2021-04-27 15:14:56] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: please refresh yourself on the rules
