[2021-04-18 03:24:41] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I guess what I need support with is feeling okay for having felt happy the past 3 weeks. 
Triggers include: ||suicide of a friend and having been suicidal in the past, and talking about missing said friends funeral||
I can spoiler anything tho

[2021-04-18 03:30:07] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: mind telling me what's up
[2021-04-18 03:32:35] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: A friend from my old church group ended his life two months ago, I was really depressed before and at the time, but then a few weeks later I started crocheting again and and became happier. Now that I’m overthinking things, I feel so guilty for having been happy for 3 weeks straight and for missing his funeral even tho we hadn’t talked in a few years.
[2021-04-18 03:41:46] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: being happy doesn't mean you don't care about that person and that you don't honor their death. you're allowed to be happy. sometimes we have things happen in our own lives and we can't do the things that we later regret in life but that doesn't make you a shitty person. you were dealing with your own problems at the time.
[2021-04-18 03:44:41] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I know you’re right, I guess I just need a reminder sometimes
I’m also frustrated that I’ll never understand exactly why he did it (even though I know it’s probably better not to know) and that I probably won’t be able to find peace with it.
[2021-04-18 03:46:35] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i know it's difficult to find closure when you don't have the parts of information you feel like you need, however, there are ways to find peace with knowing you won't get that closure.
[2021-04-18 03:48:07] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: True, finding peace probably means without the guilt though, but I’ll be working on that
[2021-04-18 03:54:37] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: honestly you can still feel guilt and find peace. it's understanding that how you feel is ok and that's ok to feel guilty about it sometimes but it doesn't mean that you're a bad person.
[2021-04-18 03:57:47] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Okay, I guess the worst part guilt-wise is that my friend (who was closer to him) also missed it due to being sick, and even though I know he is gone and can’t know who went to his funeral, if he knew that we both missed it he’d probably think that he truly was alone, when both my other friend and I would have been there for him had either of us known.
[2021-04-18 03:59:08] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i think he would know that he wasn't truly alone because you are obviously guilt over missing it. if you didn't care then you wouldn't feel bad about missing it. he isn't alone because you do care about him.
[2021-04-18 04:00:02] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Oh...I didn’t think of it that way
[2021-04-18 04:01:21] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: it isn't about being there at the funeral but instead about how you choose to remember them in the present and future.
[2021-04-18 04:02:06] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i completely get the guilt of not going to the funeral, however, that doesn't mean you didn't care about that person. circumstances happen.
[2021-04-18 04:03:24] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Part of it was just me not wanting to go, not because of him but because of me. But I’m feeling better now, thank you for your words of wisdom, and I think I’m going to go to sleep now since it’s past 11pm
[2021-04-18 04:04:23] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: alright. good night weehehe. i'm glad you're feeling better <3
[2021-04-18 04:04:33] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Thank you!
