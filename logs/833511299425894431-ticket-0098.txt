[2021-04-19 03:30:38] (816103117183123476) |-+𝕞𝕒𝕜𝕠 𝕤𝕪𝕤𝕥𝕖𝕞+-|#6610: my emotions are overwhelming. i feel so hyper, in a bad way i want to hit myself with a brick, i want to run on to the road screaming my fears, i want to scratch my neck till it bleeds.  i keep hearing voices they're yelling, screaming. i want it to stop. i feel like i'm invisible to everyone i know, like do i exist at this point? i feel like commiting a crime
[2021-04-19 04:16:35] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i understand. you do exist however. you’re not invisible to me. i know how hard it is to deal with intrusive thoughts. do you think you try some coping mechanisms to take your mind off of them?
