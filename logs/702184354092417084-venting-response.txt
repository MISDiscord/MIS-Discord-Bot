[2021-04-09 02:46:59] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Hi
[2021-04-09 02:47:52] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: i just am
[2021-04-09 02:48:20] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: no one wants to talk to me tbh
[2021-04-09 02:49:35] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Well, idk if you mean irl or discord, but Iâ€™m talking to you now and the people in the other chat are too, I could tell you werenâ€™t happy which is why I suggested going to a heavy channel (to keep the light one happier)
[2021-04-09 02:51:00] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: ok heavy
[2021-04-09 02:51:39] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Oh I didnâ€™t mean switching again sorry, my bad
[2021-04-09 02:53:23] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: oh lol u here
[2021-04-09 02:53:31] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Yeah sorry!
[2021-04-09 02:57:11] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I just was going to say, I donâ€™t think youâ€™re annoying though, I havenâ€™t talked to you that much but I havenâ€™t seen you do anything that seems annoying even though Iâ€™ve seen you say multiple times that you think you are 

I used to think everything I did was annoying but I think the thing that helped me the most was finding things I had in common with other people and talking about those things and listening as well so that I wouldnâ€™t take over a conversation and potentially annoy people. 
I hope Iâ€™m making sense oof
[2021-04-09 02:58:36] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: i found a server for a game
[2021-04-09 02:58:48] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: but i kept anoyying everyone
[2021-04-09 02:59:13] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Did they say that you were?
[2021-04-09 03:00:32] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: i kept askng for help
[2021-04-09 03:00:45] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: With the game?
[2021-04-09 03:03:22] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: hoi4
[2021-04-09 03:05:01] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Idk what that means, sorry
[2021-04-09 03:06:24] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: hearts of iron 4
[2021-04-09 03:06:51] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Ohh. I was asking if you were asking them for help with the game or something else?
[2021-04-09 03:07:13] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: If you needed help with the game, they should have helped since it was a server for the game
[2021-04-09 03:08:11] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: they did
[2021-04-09 03:08:48] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Then that doesnâ€™t sound like you were annoying
[2021-04-09 03:17:34] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: but i kept asking and doing shit wrong they got anoyyed with me
[2021-04-09 03:19:20] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Oh. People stink. You gotta be nicer to yourself because relying on people (especially online) usually leads to feeling worse
[2021-04-09 03:20:05] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: i dont like myself
[2021-04-09 03:21:25] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I know, Iâ€™ve been there too, and I donâ€™t fully like myself either. But itâ€™s possible to find the good parts of yourself since we are all stuck with ourselves for the rest of our lives
[2021-04-09 03:22:27] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: stuck with ourselves for the rest of our lives
[2021-04-09 03:22:34] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: god i hate that fcat
[2021-04-09 03:24:51] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I hate it most of the time, but it gets easier when you find good things about yourself because I know you have good things about you, mostly everyone does and the good things outweigh the less good qualities
[2021-04-09 03:25:51] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: thier is nothing good
[2021-04-09 03:27:29] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: So you think youâ€™re 100% bad? That would mean you werenâ€™t human
And just because you donâ€™t see the good doesnâ€™t mean it doesnâ€™t exist
[2021-04-09 03:32:09] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: ||i mean tbh i consider myself lesser||
[2021-04-09 03:32:33] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Youâ€™re not though
[2021-04-09 03:32:49] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Itâ€™s a valid feeling, but that doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s true
[2021-04-09 03:34:25] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: i just dont know what im sopposed to do
[2021-04-09 03:38:28] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: The thing that really helped me was finding a hobby that didnâ€™t have any pressure related to it, like without deadlines or selling anything. 
But I understand not everyone has time for that. At this point in life, I think weâ€™re supposed to find what makes us happy and work on ourselves (by that I mean figure out who you are and be happy with yourself. Itâ€™s possible)
[2021-04-09 03:39:12] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: what hobby
[2021-04-09 03:39:52] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Mine is crochet, but a lot of people find that boring. I also do music, but that can be difficult. Literally anything that isnâ€™t harmful can be a hobby though
[2021-04-09 03:41:36] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: isent that the horse stick game
[2021-04-09 03:42:33] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: No thatâ€™s croquet I think. Crochet is making things such as animals or blankets or even clothes with yarn
[2021-04-09 03:43:24] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: ohh lol oki
[2021-04-09 03:43:31] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: sounds cute
[2021-04-09 03:43:38] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: i couldent do that
[2021-04-09 03:44:21] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Itâ€™s actually pretty easy, but itâ€™s intimidating at the beginning. I like it because it gives my hand something to do
[2021-04-09 03:45:59] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: idk
[2021-04-09 03:46:03] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: im sorry
[2021-04-09 03:46:08] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: that im

[2021-04-09 03:47:19] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: No itâ€™s oki, rambling is allowed when venting ðŸ™‚
[2021-04-09 03:48:27] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: yey
[2021-04-09 03:48:48] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: i cant get to do my hw
[2021-04-09 03:52:23] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Ok, I hope you donâ€™t take this personally because This has nothing to do with you, but Iâ€™m a little sleepy so Iâ€™m gonna hang out in the light chat. If you need support you can always ping support or I think they have tickets for support now? I donâ€™t know but there are people here for you
[2021-04-09 03:54:17] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: ok thank you
[2021-04-09 11:21:42] (704391930334937169) Queer.emo666#1787: Quick update, my teacher was okay with the fact that I didn't get to finish it. He didn't ask questions (thank god), and I have another week to finish it
[2021-04-09 15:01:02] (768389205893578752) bloodovicha#3320: that's good. Make sure you let your friends know it's not a kind thing to say and that it really hurts you.
[2021-04-09 15:59:59] (704391930334937169) Queer.emo666#1787: Yeah I did. He apologized
[2021-04-09 16:00:05] (704391930334937169) Queer.emo666#1787: It's something
[2021-04-09 16:33:20] (768389205893578752) bloodovicha#3320: it's a start, pay attention to whether he tries to improve or not
