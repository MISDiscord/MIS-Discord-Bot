[2021-04-09 02:47:52] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: i just am
[2021-04-09 02:48:20] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: no one wants to talk to me tbh
[2021-04-09 02:49:35] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Well, idk if you mean irl or discord, but I’m talking to you now and the people in the other chat are too, I could tell you weren’t happy which is why I suggested going to a heavy channel (to keep the light one happier)
[2021-04-09 02:51:00] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: ok heavy
[2021-04-09 02:51:39] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Oh I didn’t mean switching again sorry, my bad
[2021-04-09 02:53:23] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: oh lol u here
[2021-04-09 02:53:31] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Yeah sorry!
[2021-04-09 02:57:11] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I just was going to say, I don’t think you’re annoying though, I haven’t talked to you that much but I haven’t seen you do anything that seems annoying even though I’ve seen you say multiple times that you think you are 

I used to think everything I did was annoying but I think the thing that helped me the most was finding things I had in common with other people and talking about those things and listening as well so that I wouldn’t take over a conversation and potentially annoy people. 
I hope I’m making sense oof
[2021-04-09 02:58:36] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: i found a server for a game

[2021-04-09 03:00:32] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: i kept askng for help
[2021-04-09 03:00:45] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: With the game?

[2021-04-09 03:06:51] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Ohh. I was asking if you were asking them for help with the game or something else?
[2021-04-09 03:07:13] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: If you needed help with the game, they should have helped since it was a server for the game
[2021-04-09 03:08:11] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: they did
[2021-04-09 03:08:48] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Then that doesn’t sound like you were annoying
[2021-04-09 03:17:34] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: but i kept asking and doing shit wrong they got anoyyed with me
[2021-04-09 03:19:20] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Oh. People stink. You gotta be nicer to yourself because relying on people (especially online) usually leads to feeling worse
[2021-04-09 03:20:05] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: i dont like myself
[2021-04-09 03:21:25] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I know, I’ve been there too, and I don’t fully like myself either. But it’s possible to find the good parts of yourself since we are all stuck with ourselves for the rest of our lives
[2021-04-09 03:22:27] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: stuck with ourselves for the rest of our lives
[2021-04-09 03:22:34] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: god i hate that fcat
[2021-04-09 03:24:51] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I hate it most of the time, but it gets easier when you find good things about yourself because I know you have good things about you, mostly everyone does and the good things outweigh the less good qualities
[2021-04-09 03:25:51] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: thier is nothing good
[2021-04-09 03:27:29] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: So you think you’re 100% bad? That would mean you weren’t human
And just because you don’t see the good doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist
[2021-04-09 03:32:09] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: ||i mean tbh i consider myself lesser||
[2021-04-09 03:32:33] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: You’re not though
[2021-04-09 03:32:49] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: It’s a valid feeling, but that doesn’t mean it’s true
[2021-04-09 03:34:25] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: i just dont know what im sopposed to do
[2021-04-09 03:38:28] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: The thing that really helped me was finding a hobby that didn’t have any pressure related to it, like without deadlines or selling anything. 
But I understand not everyone has time for that. At this point in life, I think we’re supposed to find what makes us happy and work on ourselves (by that I mean figure out who you are and be happy with yourself. It’s possible)
[2021-04-09 03:39:12] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: what hobby
[2021-04-09 03:39:52] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Mine is crochet, but a lot of people find that boring. I also do music, but that can be difficult. Literally anything that isn’t harmful can be a hobby though
[2021-04-09 03:41:36] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: isent that the horse stick game
[2021-04-09 03:42:33] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: No that’s croquet I think. Crochet is making things such as animals or blankets or even clothes with yarn
[2021-04-09 03:43:24] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: ohh lol oki
[2021-04-09 03:43:31] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: sounds cute
[2021-04-09 03:43:38] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: i couldent do that
[2021-04-09 03:44:21] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: It’s actually pretty easy, but it’s intimidating at the beginning. I like it because it gives my hand something to do
[2021-04-09 03:45:59] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: idk

If you need support you can always ping support or I think they have tickets for support now? I don’t know but there are people here for you

[2021-04-09 15:01:02] (768389205893578752) bloodovicha#3320: that's good. Make sure you let your friends know it's not a kind thing to say and that it really hurts you.

[2021-04-11 01:05:06] (829482636589269003) .moon.#6388: The thing is, I went through that phase when I was bout 12, where I would fake being a psychopath and people just assumed it was me trying to be "QUIRKY" or "not like other girls" and they never even took a minute to think deeper into why I was doing it. No, it wasn't for attention that I had a lack of. The truth, that no one ever discovered about that phase was that I did it to appear strong, (I now understand that is different from psychopathy but back then I didn't know). For example, I was and still am, a hyper-empathist, and I have always hated it, it makes me feel weak and vulnerable and ignorant so I always told people I was a psychopath and that I didn't understand empathy. Another example, I was and constantly am getting gaslighted and manipulated by friends and family, so I told them all I was the master of manipulation and a psychopath. People were always disloyal and not honest with me, so I told them I was a sociopathic pathological liar, mastermind. But no, my family and friends and acquaintances were so black and white with their thinking that they just denied the possibility of deeper meaning, And you know the phrase "fake it, till ya make it."? Well, I did that, and I became the master of hiding my emotions. And that's how I turned out fucking mentally ill.
[2021-04-11 01:16:24] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i don't think this is appropriate for this server since you're discussing faking a disorder. i would kindly ask that you delete. if you would like to rant about this subject, i would avoid discussing faking a disorder.

[2021-04-11 09:35:13] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: If they made you feel uncomfortable like that, then you are right to block them. Nobody should have to put up with being ||called hurtful names or told/showed things not appropriate||. Unless you gave out certain personal information, they likely aren't going to be able to track you down (my background is computer science, but I have net security experience) and you shouldn't worry too much. Hope that helps.

||i like someone a lot, but they already are in a relationship. ive told them multiple times i like them and they just dont seem to care. ive told myself multiple times that its not meant to be, or that they dont like me, but nothing can erase the pain i feel.
ive tried to commit suicide multiple times because the pain i feel just swallows me whole every time i see the person i like with their significant other.
ive hurt myself multiple times over this and i honestly dont know what to do anymore. i dont like anyone else nor do i want to. i feel like im being dramatic, but it just hurts me- it feels like someone is shredding my heart into a million pieces.
i keep trying to forget about it, and ive tried to just keep myself away from them- but that didnt work either. i felt more hurt away from them.
am i being dramatic.? because this broken heart is the worst thing ive ever felt-||

I have ADHD and ADD, and I'm not sure if I have BPD, which might be true, although I haven't sought medical attention for it. It happens sometimes. My mood sometimes switches from energetic to irritable and angry, and I don't know why.

[2021-04-12 15:17:23] (685602297316900943) Dangarii#9609: That begs the question.. Can one have both ADHD and ADD?

[2021-04-12 15:21:06] (685602297316900943) Dangarii#9609: So, now, instead of ADD in the past, I have ADHD in the present?
[2021-04-12 15:21:23] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: there's different subtypes (predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, combined) but it's all adhd
[2021-04-12 15:21:39] (685602297316900943) Dangarii#9609: My brother has it.. I've witnessed the mood changes he has because of it.

[2021-04-12 15:23:56] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: so my diagnosis is fairly new. maybe a month old. it was something that was brought up after my breakup with my ex due to severity of my reaction to the breakup. since i've recently started a ||medication to reduce my mood swings||, i feel a bit more normal, however before i could feel ||very depressed|| in the morning and then ||manic|| in the evening. it was very exhausting because there's never a moment that you feel "normal". plus that doesn't get into the issues with any kind of relationships that you have when you have bpd. i get anxious in all of my personal relationships and often will assume the worst. essentially i keep waiting for everyone to abandon me.
[2021-04-12 15:27:32] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: How does one distinguish between bpd and attachment disorders?
[2021-04-12 15:28:08] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i would honestly probably ask a psychiatrist but bpd has a lot of requirements in the dsm-5

[2021-04-12 15:30:53] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah i actually have quiet bpd
[2021-04-12 15:31:11] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: there's four different types of bpd
[2021-04-12 15:31:42] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: quiet bpd just means that you internalize your feelings more than the other types

[2021-04-12 20:32:14] (735240227224027196) sweetenedk#9496: I think instead of waiting for motivation, try to use your fear to push you to start. I’ve been going through the same thing in uni and I’ve realised motivation is bullshit for me, to get started I had to think about the consequences of not doing the work
[2021-04-12 20:32:46] (735240227224027196) sweetenedk#9496: Motivation then helps me to keep continuing those habits because I feel way better and less anxious once I’ve done my work and I want to keep feeling that

[2021-04-12 20:46:20] (651068724304019506) SM_Dark#5993: Reading out loud just makes me focus on trying to actually read it out loud, though the teaching it to the walls one is new, I guess I can try that when I'm actually done reading. Though it is already like midnight and i don't have much time.

[2021-04-13 08:38:38] (757294039069360138) mah_name_jeff#1490: apologies, ik this is a lot
[2021-04-13 09:37:23] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Much feels, I'm sorry you are having a bad experience. Your family may actually care, but it seems like they don't understand or accept your dilemma as legitimate, which seems like a disturbingly common phenomenon. I would try and establish legitimacy with them by expressing (in the most calm way possible) that you aren't choosing to experience these ||mood swings|| or stress, that it's not fair to call you selfish or ungrateful when you are just trying to feel better. Remind them that it's up to a psych professional to diagnose you and oversee your treatment, but that they can be supportive simply by being good listeners and non-judgmental.
Of course, if they do not respond logically, then maybe it might be better to not rely on them emotionally if you can, because bad "support" can sometimes be worse than no support at all.
[2021-04-13 09:49:14] (757294039069360138) mah_name_jeff#1490: i think its my fault

I hate my body and I hate myself. I have no one to talk to. I just want to be killed by someone already. I wish a car just ran over me or someone would come to shoot me in the head.

I don’t deserve life. I want the pain to end. I can’t handle it anymore.

I’m a creep and a disgusting perverted loser. I’m fucking degenerate subhuman trash. I’m a mentally ill piece of shit that should just be murdered already. I wish my parents killed me. I wish I was euthanized. I wish I was dead.

I hate living. I hate the pain of existence. I hate my body. I hate my brain. I hate my thoughts. I hate my feelings. I hate everything.

I have no one to talk to. My parents will hate me. My sister will hate me. I have no friends. Every other person out there with my problems is mentally ill and can’t handle what I say. I will trigger them to kill themselves. I can’t afford a therapist. I don’t have insurance. I can’t do anything.

Just end my life someone. Please just shoot me.||

However- things WILL and DO get better. you're not pointless OR worthless. you're young- your life isn't even close to over. there's still so much more- and I know that that tends to be the worst part but if you look at it in the right ways it's not, it's the best part of life. Everyone- has rough years, and hard times. Everyone just sits down alone and watches YouTube depressed at some point in their life. You're not the worst at everything, you're not dumb. Stop lying to yourself and saying you are because you're not. I doubt that you look ugly, and even if you think you do- looks don't matter. not at all. Also- having a grave doesn't make you remembered, being alive makes you remembered. Your family will always remember you, and so will your friends. Those people that you walk by at school who smile- might be going through the same thing you are, just- hiding it with a smile.

My family is refusing to acknowledge my depression and im spiraling again and I am so scared im going to loose everything I have done so far. I am 5 months clean and that is crumbling around me right now. I have to force myself out of bed every dan and I lost my gpa because I just dont have the fucking motivation. I feel so fake around my family, bcause I am trying to make it seem like I have gotten better, when in reality im still the girl who get turned down by a psychiatric unit for the sole purpose of COVID overcrouding. I was supposed t go into IOP and that never even happened. I know it is stupid and selfish, but i want someone to notice I AM STILL STRUGGLING. just for a day, I know ther people need the therapy way more, but I would like to get in touch with at least someone to talk to. I also started high school this year, and between the pandemic and me not having friends at the school and my constant rejection dysphoria I have nothing to hold onto at this point. honestly I started shifting back into ||suicidal thoughts|| an it fucking scares me, but at the same time I don't have anythign to loose.

Then a few minutes later my other classmates who were sitting in front of me started to make fun of me and take advantage of me. I just had enough and went to the toilet to get away from them but had to return because i had been sitting there for a while. so i went back then the girl who moved away from me said that she didn't hear me. i felt very pissed at her. then she approached me to give me a hug. i just didnt want a hug from her, so i pushed her away. it turned out i was being filmed by those girls who were sitting in front of me. then the girl who moved away from me went to them and was like. "i was trying to give (her) a hug but she just pushed (her) away... blah blah blah" while laughing at me and stuff. The fact that they filmed me without my permission just really... hurt me. they also started purposely mispronouncing my name. i perked up when they purposely mispronounced my name and they were like "see? i got her(my) attention hahaha..." it just makes me so sad and i really want to change schools next term. or even just end my life so i have to go through this

I've come to terms with the fact that I won't have a healthy relationship with you for a while - I need to work on myself before I hear you ramble about why you know you weren't a good dad because you were never around, so don't force me to talk to you because *you* feel bad - give me time to breath and adjust.||

I wish I didn't overthink. I wish I'd just stick to the present and keep going instead of only thinking of being happy and the true person I want to be. I think I can do things even though I know damn well it's not in my skill range. Stupid enough I even think of fictional things- for example a classic 3-wish genie.. Damnit. What happens when I go too far? It'll be a topic for tomorrow night I guess, my realm of thoughts in my bed or at my desk with a blanket over my shoulders. Who knows..||
[2021-04-21 12:08:36] (758700435258343454) luku#2148: I need help. Honestly, I really do. I show symptoms of so many things. Plus I've been having people pleasing issues and for the last 2 days I've been stressing over people maybe hating me because of one text. That's why I kind of hate text, I get so scared from texts and I dont even know what tone they're trying to put off. Plus, a lot of drama in my real life has been happening. I've never been bullied before and I just experienced it. I really need some help and I need to look into places where I get that help.

Does anyone have any advice for overthinking or gifted kid burnout problems? I honestly need a ton of advice here.

[2021-04-21 12:12:29] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Actually I can relate to the overthinking issues and the many symptoms thing. I think firstly you should ask for help like you said, and if you're in the US, you should be able to talk to your counselor if you can't find a therapist, or even find a therapist through your counselor if you're in a school. But there are also wellness centers that I assume can also get you help?

Also, maybe tell your friends that you're close to about tone indicators. That should help clear up confusions, and if they're good friends, they'll undeerstand <:hugs:771753710526267403>

[2021-04-21 17:00:24] (506968571449180170) NebulousNids#1689: My friends and I were walking and they were talking to each other and not really me and like thats fine, I just Am Me and it really hurt. Like I have psycoanalyzed myself and I know *why* but like it feels like there's nothing I can *do* about it. Like I know communication is key but like, what do I even say in that scenario? "It felt like you were ignoring me when you weren't explicitly involving me in your conversation earlier" I'm not gonna say that it just feels rude, like I can't expect them to always pointedly include me. And like the alternative is going "Hey, I have attachment issues because you ignored me for 9 years straight and I'm still not emotinally convinced that you actually like me" which I also feel like I shouldn't really say. And I don't know how to stop feeling so ridiculously hurt whenever my friends aren't paying attention to me. And I know logically they like me and stuff but brain keeps telling me I'm being a burden and I dont know how to make that stop and I wouldn't even know how to tell if I *was* being a burden or not, so like I'm probably not but I can't really be sure
I dont know

i asked for cat ear headphones for christmas, he got me crappy $30 headphones, which i would have been fine with *if they were what i asked for*. but they're just plain, no fun.
now im so afraid to even ask for gifts it takes me weeks to say *anything* about what i want for any occasion. 
boy this sure sounds whiny just about *gifts*, you know, the things you get for free.

My parents are pissed, they're so done with me, they hate him. they hate the one person i love. It shouldnt have been as big of a deal as it was but it was homophobic for sure. Now im scared im going to get sent to a different school. my bf isnt even going there next year, hes doing online. it feels like everyone is going against me, even my own head. i question if i should just end it a lot, i love him but he hurts me so much. its kind of ruined my life but, i guess i need to decide if im going to love him, or if im going to take my parents more seriously. this is the toughest choice ive ever had to make and its so down to the wire. im so tempted to just grab my bottle of pills and take one to many. im so done with everyone and everything, he was my last hope, the only person who cared and now i cant even have that. fuck life, fuck people, fuck myself and my stupidity, i just want it to go back to how it was, i dont want this. fuck||

Finding someone you really love and care for isn't the easiest thing and lots of people struggle with it. I'm sure that if you do stay with him over time things will work out and become better. Keep going, things may seem tough but I promise you they will get better if you let them and if you give it time. 

if you wanna break up with him because of your parents and because of *others* then don't. If *you* want to do it and you feel it will make things better then do what *you* want, not what *others* want.

[2021-04-24 15:55:12] (714866901741862973) Byama#3003: I’m so sick and tired of everything and everyone. People talk to me and say they will help me but as soon as I start to open up they’re gone. I’ll go from talking to them all the time to them ignoring me. The only reason I know this is because they’ll snap my friends and just not answer me. I’m tired of being stepped all over and being taken advantage of because I’m too nice and want to help people who need it. I want to be able to have someone who I can talk to without getting left and thrown into the dust after a few weeks. I feel like I can’t open up or trust anyone anymore because it has happened so many times. I know I need to focus on myself and I am but helping others is the only thing that I’m slightly good at.

(when my class was supposed to set up a play thingy for our graduation, i was given my dialogue and... it was all in singular words, not in sentences? and when i asked why the whole class, including the teacher, told me that that's how i talk – really fast and in singular words. everyone else had normal lines. i took it well but the very subtle humiliation is still there)

[2021-04-25 18:41:31] (467747778622259221) greywolfember#0072: hey, I just wanna pop in here and say that if you want to get tested and you're holding yourself back because you think you can't have depression because you've got a conventionally good life and have nothing to be sad about, I'd really recommend you get tested, and if it comes back saying you're not depressed then that's that. if you're worried about depression and saying things like you have nothing to be sad about, but you are sad and ruminating over this, it's absolutely very possible you're depressed. people with depression absolutely can be people who lead surface-level good lives and supposedly have nothing to be sad about. if you're sad, you're sad, and that's the truth of it, and that is /okay/. the realness of you being sad is not made any less than other people who are sad and with "better" reasons.

Folks with DID and OSDD had nowhere else to turn besides their own head, leaving them to forming the ultimate coping mechanism. Anyone struggling with it is strong, and you Elliot are strong as well. I hope you find healthier ways to cope.

I was at the mall and feeling okay today until I looked in a mirror and saw ||how disgustingly fat I am, like I dressed cute but I look obese (I literally don’t have a problem with anyone else being overweight or obese, they still manage to look good, I’m just so fucking ugly)|| and I felt all these old emotions about myself that I’ve really felt most of my life but was able to ||suppress before I gained a ton of weight ||
And then it got worse... I was still feeling crappy about it and just wanted to go home but as we were walking I saw one of my friends (who I’ve tried and tried to not have feelings for, but I can’t choose who I like) and we talked for a bit and it went well but afterwards I was so scared that my friend now thinks I ||look disgusting|| I’m still worried about it. ||I just want to be skinny and that feels so impossible||

[2021-04-27 01:54:40] (539665656761679883) Sombra#8326: My therapist is getting things in order for special accommodations in college and he needs to talk to my psychiatrist to make sure diagnoses match. 

When I went to the hospital I was given the label of schizoaffective depressive type. ||suicide|| related thoughts were present at the time and the doctor at the hospital thought that equated to depression. I actually considered ending it for a different reason. At the time I believed there was a computer chip implanted inside of my brain and it had many functions. I thought it let people read my thoughts, controlled my emotions, made noise, allowed people to put thoughts in my head, etc. I considered ||dying|| so I would no longer be controlled. My main plan was to surgically remove it myself but I thought of ending it if that failed. It wasn’t sadness or prominent mood problems. I just wanted to escape. I described things some more. My therapist says it sounds more like schizophrenia. But it still says schizoaffective on my record. I just want things to be precise. So I’m hoping they don’t put schizoaffective disorder as the diagnosis. 

I told them it wouldn’t affect my education much. I will admit that school and learning is pretty much impossible during an episode, but I don’t have episodes often. And if they do occur there is nothing to do about it accommodations wise. 

I just thought I’d get this off of my chest. 

I was advised by my therapist to talk to my psychiatrist to give my side of the story. I need to make a phone call and get the email for the main office and then send an email and tell the office people to forward it to my psychiatrist. Although I have difficulty talking on the phone so who knows how long that will take.

[2021-04-29 03:01:42] (760973651054428200) Alec#2260: I always have horrible flashbacks of my past of when i was 5,7,8,9,10,11, and 12.. Idk how to explain it but like When i was 5 my father because abusive to my mother and verbally abusive to me, one night my mother and father had a fight so bad that police were called and my father was arrested for violence and abuse. I woke up in the morning to blood on the wall and a hole in the call... 

When i was 7 my father came back (He was still an alcoholic) me and my siblings could only see him at his mothers house nowhere else. He had a fight with his mother and left us there all by ourselves.

When i was 9 he came back again with a gf this time.. me and my siblings went to his house for a couple months and my father and his used to be gf are alcoholics. They would leave us home alone for at least 3-5 hours at a time sometimes longer.

again when i was 9 i was harassed and sexually assault everyday for about a year (not by my father but by someone else).. It stopped when i was 10 and when i was 9 i became suicidal and started planning ways to kms

when i was 10 i tried to kms for the first time
[2021-04-29 03:05:17] (760973651054428200) Alec#2260: ||and like, When i was 11 my father came back with a different gf. We seen him every week day and weekend. I went over the most so i seen all the fights...
my father got drunk one night and came back at 3:26am (I remember this because it was right before my b-day) me and him got into a little argument earlier that night and i told him i hated him because he wasn't around. When i went inside i hid from him for the rest of the night and stayed up all night because i know that something was going to happen because of what i said. in the morning i could hear him getting pissed off and i knew something was going to happen, i went out and got all the stuff for the baby for when she woke up to make sure she didn't have to feel uncomfortable.. When i got back into my room i hear a smash and i went my father and his gfs room to make sure nothing happened and the tv and her phone was smashed, my father was laying down in bed again and Ange (His now ex-gf) was crying because he kicked her off the bed, i went back into my room because i was scared and i could hear my father yelling because he was mad at Ange.. Both of my sisters woke up and i changed the babys diaper because she was uncomfortable.. i went back out and wanted to run outside but my father was outside his room and he went downstairs, i could hear the back door break down and windows smashing, he came back in and went back upstairs and started yelling again, i went into the room and seen him punching Ange in the face, he chased me but tripped and i went back into the room and texted my mother and she came, got us, called the police, got the kids, drove us out of range of the house, and helped Ange get away from my father.

and when i was 11 i developed an eating disorder and started smoking

When i was 12 (This year) 2 of my friends killed themselves and i had 5 attempts and none of 'em worked||

When I first meet me 2-3 friends back in 4th grade, it wasn’t hard because of how social and innocent I was back then. But now that I’m 15, the way I look at myself is just...****. Ive been told and asked by family members; “Why are you wearing that?“ or “Go put on something else. Something more fitting.“ I’ve  even told myself stuff like; “God, you’re ugly. You need to get yourself together. You’ll never succeed looking like this!” They don’t know what I’ve been trailing myself for the past 4-6 years! I just want this to end. They think it stopped when I got a certain injury and learned that I didn’t trust anyone to tell them my problems. But little do they know that my self hatred hasn’t stopped. In fact, it’s only increased since then. I don’t know to talk to, I feel intimidated by practically everyone around me. How am I supposed to get rid of the self hatred demon that’s been living in my head for years?!? How do I tell others how I truly feel without them worrying too much about me. While they do love me, they’ve got other things more important than me. I don’t know how to counteract this. Or is it too late for me...||
[2021-04-29 14:07:34] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: well i got rid of all emotions all together but i don't think that would be a good idea

[2021-04-29 14:33:29] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: But also I've definitely been in one of those

[2021-04-29 15:39:13] (743625723847114914) avocadorable#1392: My therapist told my mom I ||self-harm|| so she sat me down and ||told me how she felt to later slap me across the face. She told me that if I wanted to die to go ahead and die because after all, thats my decision||
[2021-04-29 15:39:51] (743625723847114914) avocadorable#1392: So now, ||I wanna die even more||
[2021-04-29 15:41:52] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: well that bad parenting
[2021-04-29 15:43:25] (743625723847114914) avocadorable#1392: And worse is ||I still see her as a great parent and blame her current attitude on my grades as she is beyond pissed off because my grades are mediocre||
[2021-04-29 15:44:21] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -I don't wish to say this 'bout thy mother but her definition of solvin' these kind of things is as flawed as her parenting overall.-
[2021-04-29 15:45:11] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: Medicore is good enough in my opinion.
Not everybody wants to be the best of the best, nor does everybody can or have to.
[2021-04-29 15:47:19] (743625723847114914) avocadorable#1392: ||She told me how we came to this country to get a future and that I'm going nowhere in life. That sometimes she wishes to send me off to where my dad lived where I almost did die lol. I had gotten good grades (my lowest being 93) first quarter as I was in person but since she switched me to online as a punishment I started to fail. I told her to switch me back but she didnt want to so now... idk||
[2021-04-29 15:48:02] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: it her fault then
[2021-04-29 15:48:07] (743625723847114914) avocadorable#1392: For my mom, it isn't. She graduated 6 years of college in a scholarship
[2021-04-29 15:49:09] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: she is too ignorant to understand how you feel and she only wants to make herself feel better
[2021-04-29 15:49:25] (743625723847114914) avocadorable#1392: She told me to assume my deal because this is my fault. Yes, it kinda is but part of her fault too. She just doesn't feel bad. She is going to make me work a summer job and she told me she'll use her money on botox and stuff
[2021-04-29 15:49:54] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: well that show's she is unfit to be a parent
[2021-04-29 15:49:55] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -Thy situation is not liveable but your mother won't get to her senses any time soon, I assume.-
[2021-04-29 15:50:29] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: but if she comes to her senses maybe it will be better
[2021-04-29 15:50:44] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: i hope the best for you ;3
[2021-04-29 15:51:37] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: Maybe everything will turn into a happy ending?
[2021-04-29 15:51:53] (743625723847114914) avocadorable#1392: She is a dedicated parent though.|| She understood I liked girls and let me have a girlfriend but now is currently threatening me to out her to her abusive and homophobic parents. I had knee surgery and she takes me to therapy everyday. So, I have mixed feelings.||
[2021-04-29 15:52:45] (743625723847114914) avocadorable#1392: I honestly don't know
[2021-04-29 15:54:00] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: Well, at least she has good parts in her parenting but not everything is nice.
[2021-04-29 15:55:21] (743625723847114914) avocadorable#1392: I don't know
[2021-04-29 15:55:28] (743625723847114914) avocadorable#1392: we were good until she checked my grades
[2021-04-29 15:56:02] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: if grades make her miss treat you this is not a good sign
[2021-04-29 15:57:42] (743625723847114914) avocadorable#1392: what does that mean tho?
[2021-04-29 15:59:29] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: Well, hmmm.
[2021-04-29 16:12:26] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: like one mistake and she does not like ya and cures ya and say she will send ya away
[2021-04-29 16:29:29] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i wanna stop being a monster and hurting everyone i care about. why do i keep ||existing|| when all i cause is pain for others? no wonder everyone leaves. i'm one of the worst people to exist.
[2021-04-29 16:32:25] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: You help a lot of people, Jupiter. You do much more than cause pain. It is impossible not to hurt the ones you love, unfortunately. They only want the best for you, and when you aren't getting that they hurt. Love is pain. That pain is worth it for everything else that comes along with it.
[2021-04-29 16:35:21] (772525174791733258) Vlok Fox#0361: -While knowing nothin' 'bout your past, from what I saw of you doing / saying inhere, you're no monster.-
[2021-04-29 16:37:08] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: You are not a monster and we are so lucky to know you and have you as a mod. You are sweet, amazing, kind and a person of culture <:eyyy:712384927018254356>
[2021-04-29 16:37:41] (743625723847114914) avocadorable#1392: Jupiter, you are amazing. You are here for a motive and always succeed to help people feel slightly better. You are not a monster. Yes, we all commit mistakes in the past but that does not define you as a person. I'm glad you exist because of all the people you have helped heal or feel better. I'm proud of you for being strong even during this hurtful times.
[2021-04-29 16:38:25] (743625723847114914) avocadorable#1392: don't forget being extremely respectful
[2021-04-29 16:54:26] (746038046310531084) Astolfo#2160: it might cheer ya up but you are just yourself if they leave with out trying to understand then it thier fault not yours and i hope you are ok love ya ;3

[2021-04-29 19:29:33] (779423604248018964) 𝐊.#3949: I wrote this as a type of vent. A similar situation happened to me. I did it in order to find a type of closure, since in real life,  I didn't get that.
[2021-04-29 22:02:24] (651068724304019506) SM_Dark#5993: For the first time in such a long time, I felt happiness. I smiled and laughed and It was amazing. Until it got taken away from me. I just wanted to talk with my friends and play games with them a little longer. I didn't want the happiness to end, but it did and too quickly. Now I just feel angry/terrible/sad but also numb. I want to cry but I can't. It's like the world just said that I didn't deserve happiness, not even for 30 minutes and just took it away from me. I want to ||cut|| so badly, but I can't or else people will see.
[2021-04-29 23:56:56] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: Waves of sadness suck especially when your with your friends and they are all laughing and having a good time and you just feel a emptiness build. Don’t cut, it won’t make you feel better. You need to call your psychiatrist it sounds like you medication needs to be adjusted.
[2021-04-30 02:12:45] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: I feel so invalid tonight. I can’t mask anymore. I just want it all to end.
[2021-04-30 02:13:20] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: whatever you're going through and whatever you're feeling is incredibly valid.
[2021-04-30 02:16:47] (458408109027753986) Amanda09#2715: It just seems to all be kinda discredited right now
[2021-04-30 02:33:45] (777594341991383130) cumqueen;0#3903: sorry to kind of jump in but like Jupiter said, what you’re going through is valid. I’m sorry if it seems to be discredited right now but just know that you’ve got people like those in this server who totally support you through whatever you’re going through right now. If you ever need to talk about it I’m always here and I’m sure other people are as well
[2021-04-30 09:45:43] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: I am very mad at myself Rn for all the ||self harm|| I’ve been doing. I’ve ||cut myself, whipped myself with belts and weights, slammed my fist into hard objects, it’s like I’ve gone crazy and all I know how to do anymore is inflict pain on myself||
[2021-04-30 09:45:57] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: The problem is I’m not really sure how to stop
[2021-04-30 12:03:47] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Heya, Yarn, I think I can understand what you mean. For about a year or two I was obsessed with ||sh|| as well, and even though I only really did one major problem, I kind of came out of it with a lot of self-compassion and rest. What do you think might help for you? I know that sleep really helped me, ironically
[2021-04-30 12:16:07] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: for me i tend to ||self harm largely as a coping mechanism for signifigant stress||
[2021-04-30 12:16:20] (325983451331166208) Yarn#5024: ||usually during depressive episodes or after fights with mom and dad||
[2021-04-30 12:17:05] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Ah, I can understand. Do you think having fidgets will help, since you can manipulate the shape of many fidgets and they won't break?
[2021-04-30 12:18:12] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: <@!325983451331166208> ?

[2021-04-30 13:27:42] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Alrighty, I hope it helps! If you need anymore help maybe I can ask a friend I have who struggled with this as well
[2021-04-30 17:40:52] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: imagine telling your friend that you wouldn't replace them when you got a girlfriend and then doing exactly that and then blaming that friend for being upset about it and then telling that friend that you were so hurt by them being upset that you need to take a break from your friendship for a while
[2021-04-30 17:47:28] (305142848410484746) bOnk#8767: I know friends aren’t therapist’s but sometimes it would be nice if she wasn’t so obsessed with her bf to talk to me for 10 mins every other week when I’m upset
[2021-04-30 19:16:22] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: please remember that censoring needs to be done with || two bars on each side, not one
