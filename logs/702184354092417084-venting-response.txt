[2021-04-09 02:47:52] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: i just am
[2021-04-09 02:48:20] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: no one wants to talk to me tbh
[2021-04-09 02:49:35] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Well, idk if you mean irl or discord, but I’m talking to you now and the people in the other chat are too, I could tell you weren’t happy which is why I suggested going to a heavy channel (to keep the light one happier)
[2021-04-09 02:51:00] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: ok heavy
[2021-04-09 02:51:39] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Oh I didn’t mean switching again sorry, my bad
[2021-04-09 02:53:23] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: oh lol u here
[2021-04-09 02:53:31] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Yeah sorry!
[2021-04-09 02:57:11] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I just was going to say, I don’t think you’re annoying though, I haven’t talked to you that much but I haven’t seen you do anything that seems annoying even though I’ve seen you say multiple times that you think you are 

I used to think everything I did was annoying but I think the thing that helped me the most was finding things I had in common with other people and talking about those things and listening as well so that I wouldn’t take over a conversation and potentially annoy people. 
I hope I’m making sense oof
[2021-04-09 02:58:36] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: i found a server for a game

[2021-04-09 03:00:32] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: i kept askng for help
[2021-04-09 03:00:45] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: With the game?

[2021-04-09 03:06:51] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Ohh. I was asking if you were asking them for help with the game or something else?
[2021-04-09 03:07:13] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: If you needed help with the game, they should have helped since it was a server for the game
[2021-04-09 03:08:11] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: they did
[2021-04-09 03:08:48] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Then that doesn’t sound like you were annoying
[2021-04-09 03:17:34] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: but i kept asking and doing shit wrong they got anoyyed with me
[2021-04-09 03:19:20] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Oh. People stink. You gotta be nicer to yourself because relying on people (especially online) usually leads to feeling worse
[2021-04-09 03:20:05] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: i dont like myself
[2021-04-09 03:21:25] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I know, I’ve been there too, and I don’t fully like myself either. But it’s possible to find the good parts of yourself since we are all stuck with ourselves for the rest of our lives
[2021-04-09 03:22:27] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: stuck with ourselves for the rest of our lives
[2021-04-09 03:22:34] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: god i hate that fcat
[2021-04-09 03:24:51] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I hate it most of the time, but it gets easier when you find good things about yourself because I know you have good things about you, mostly everyone does and the good things outweigh the less good qualities
[2021-04-09 03:25:51] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: thier is nothing good
[2021-04-09 03:27:29] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: So you think you’re 100% bad? That would mean you weren’t human
And just because you don’t see the good doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist
[2021-04-09 03:32:09] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: ||i mean tbh i consider myself lesser||
[2021-04-09 03:32:33] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: You’re not though
[2021-04-09 03:32:49] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: It’s a valid feeling, but that doesn’t mean it’s true
[2021-04-09 03:34:25] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: i just dont know what im sopposed to do
[2021-04-09 03:38:28] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: The thing that really helped me was finding a hobby that didn’t have any pressure related to it, like without deadlines or selling anything. 
But I understand not everyone has time for that. At this point in life, I think we’re supposed to find what makes us happy and work on ourselves (by that I mean figure out who you are and be happy with yourself. It’s possible)
[2021-04-09 03:39:12] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: what hobby
[2021-04-09 03:39:52] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: Mine is crochet, but a lot of people find that boring. I also do music, but that can be difficult. Literally anything that isn’t harmful can be a hobby though
[2021-04-09 03:41:36] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: isent that the horse stick game
[2021-04-09 03:42:33] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: No that’s croquet I think. Crochet is making things such as animals or blankets or even clothes with yarn
[2021-04-09 03:43:24] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: ohh lol oki
[2021-04-09 03:43:31] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: sounds cute
[2021-04-09 03:43:38] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: i couldent do that
[2021-04-09 03:44:21] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: It’s actually pretty easy, but it’s intimidating at the beginning. I like it because it gives my hand something to do
[2021-04-09 03:45:59] (601041954981019678) Adamski#2686: idk

If you need support you can always ping support or I think they have tickets for support now? I don’t know but there are people here for you

[2021-04-09 15:01:02] (768389205893578752) bloodovicha#3320: that's good. Make sure you let your friends know it's not a kind thing to say and that it really hurts you.

[2021-04-11 01:05:06] (829482636589269003) .moon.#6388: The thing is, I went through that phase when I was bout 12, where I would fake being a psychopath and people just assumed it was me trying to be "QUIRKY" or "not like other girls" and they never even took a minute to think deeper into why I was doing it. No, it wasn't for attention that I had a lack of. The truth, that no one ever discovered about that phase was that I did it to appear strong, (I now understand that is different from psychopathy but back then I didn't know). For example, I was and still am, a hyper-empathist, and I have always hated it, it makes me feel weak and vulnerable and ignorant so I always told people I was a psychopath and that I didn't understand empathy. Another example, I was and constantly am getting gaslighted and manipulated by friends and family, so I told them all I was the master of manipulation and a psychopath. People were always disloyal and not honest with me, so I told them I was a sociopathic pathological liar, mastermind. But no, my family and friends and acquaintances were so black and white with their thinking that they just denied the possibility of deeper meaning, And you know the phrase "fake it, till ya make it."? Well, I did that, and I became the master of hiding my emotions. And that's how I turned out fucking mentally ill.
[2021-04-11 01:16:24] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i don't think this is appropriate for this server since you're discussing faking a disorder. i would kindly ask that you delete. if you would like to rant about this subject, i would avoid discussing faking a disorder.

[2021-04-11 09:35:13] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: If they made you feel uncomfortable like that, then you are right to block them. Nobody should have to put up with being ||called hurtful names or told/showed things not appropriate||. Unless you gave out certain personal information, they likely aren't going to be able to track you down (my background is computer science, but I have net security experience) and you shouldn't worry too much. Hope that helps.

||i like someone a lot, but they already are in a relationship. ive told them multiple times i like them and they just dont seem to care. ive told myself multiple times that its not meant to be, or that they dont like me, but nothing can erase the pain i feel.
ive tried to commit suicide multiple times because the pain i feel just swallows me whole every time i see the person i like with their significant other.
ive hurt myself multiple times over this and i honestly dont know what to do anymore. i dont like anyone else nor do i want to. i feel like im being dramatic, but it just hurts me- it feels like someone is shredding my heart into a million pieces.
i keep trying to forget about it, and ive tried to just keep myself away from them- but that didnt work either. i felt more hurt away from them.
am i being dramatic.? because this broken heart is the worst thing ive ever felt-||

I have ADHD and ADD, and I'm not sure if I have BPD, which might be true, although I haven't sought medical attention for it. It happens sometimes. My mood sometimes switches from energetic to irritable and angry, and I don't know why.

[2021-04-12 15:17:23] (685602297316900943) Dangarii#9609: That begs the question.. Can one have both ADHD and ADD?

[2021-04-12 15:21:06] (685602297316900943) Dangarii#9609: So, now, instead of ADD in the past, I have ADHD in the present?
[2021-04-12 15:21:23] (462713398187130884) moonielove244 ★#3912: there's different subtypes (predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, combined) but it's all adhd
[2021-04-12 15:21:39] (685602297316900943) Dangarii#9609: My brother has it.. I've witnessed the mood changes he has because of it.

[2021-04-12 15:23:56] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: so my diagnosis is fairly new. maybe a month old. it was something that was brought up after my breakup with my ex due to severity of my reaction to the breakup. since i've recently started a ||medication to reduce my mood swings||, i feel a bit more normal, however before i could feel ||very depressed|| in the morning and then ||manic|| in the evening. it was very exhausting because there's never a moment that you feel "normal". plus that doesn't get into the issues with any kind of relationships that you have when you have bpd. i get anxious in all of my personal relationships and often will assume the worst. essentially i keep waiting for everyone to abandon me.
[2021-04-12 15:27:32] (695635702364241930) 🎇 Hecate 💫#6865: How does one distinguish between bpd and attachment disorders?
[2021-04-12 15:28:08] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: i would honestly probably ask a psychiatrist but bpd has a lot of requirements in the dsm-5

[2021-04-12 15:30:53] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: yeah i actually have quiet bpd
[2021-04-12 15:31:11] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: there's four different types of bpd
[2021-04-12 15:31:42] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: quiet bpd just means that you internalize your feelings more than the other types

[2021-04-12 20:32:14] (735240227224027196) sweetenedk#9496: I think instead of waiting for motivation, try to use your fear to push you to start. I’ve been going through the same thing in uni and I’ve realised motivation is bullshit for me, to get started I had to think about the consequences of not doing the work
[2021-04-12 20:32:46] (735240227224027196) sweetenedk#9496: Motivation then helps me to keep continuing those habits because I feel way better and less anxious once I’ve done my work and I want to keep feeling that

[2021-04-12 20:46:20] (651068724304019506) SM_Dark#5993: Reading out loud just makes me focus on trying to actually read it out loud, though the teaching it to the walls one is new, I guess I can try that when I'm actually done reading. Though it is already like midnight and i don't have much time.

[2021-04-13 08:33:38] (757294039069360138) mah_name_jeff#1490: they think i have bipolar or something, but i can barely trust them to be professionals since they are the least logical people i know
[2021-04-13 08:34:07] (757294039069360138) mah_name_jeff#1490: their solution is for me to 'take a walk'
[2021-04-13 08:35:18] (757294039069360138) mah_name_jeff#1490: and that im selfish, and ungrateful, and i should stop inconviniencing others with my problems cooz theyre done with it
[2021-04-13 08:36:43] (757294039069360138) mah_name_jeff#1490: and the fact that they tell me they care, but are pretending that everythings fine and nothing really happened
[2021-04-13 08:37:20] (757294039069360138) mah_name_jeff#1490: the fact that they dont even know ive joined a server asking for help
[2021-04-13 08:38:38] (757294039069360138) mah_name_jeff#1490: apologies, ik this is a lot
[2021-04-13 09:37:23] (276042104084496384) Sausage Javelins#0062: Much feels, I'm sorry you are having a bad experience. Your family may actually care, but it seems like they don't understand or accept your dilemma as legitimate, which seems like a disturbingly common phenomenon. I would try and establish legitimacy with them by expressing (in the most calm way possible) that you aren't choosing to experience these ||mood swings|| or stress, that it's not fair to call you selfish or ungrateful when you are just trying to feel better. Remind them that it's up to a psych professional to diagnose you and oversee your treatment, but that they can be supportive simply by being good listeners and non-judgmental.
Of course, if they do not respond logically, then maybe it might be better to not rely on them emotionally if you can, because bad "support" can sometimes be worse than no support at all.
[2021-04-13 09:49:14] (757294039069360138) mah_name_jeff#1490: i think its my fault
[2021-04-13 09:50:11] (757294039069360138) mah_name_jeff#1490: i rarely experience happiness, and when i do the timing has to be specific, people should act a certain way, so it comes around like once a year
[2021-04-13 09:50:57] (757294039069360138) mah_name_jeff#1490: anything is a trigger, like music or a video of my taste
[2021-04-13 09:51:34] (757294039069360138) mah_name_jeff#1490: so that way i feel selfish to control people that one time of the year

[2021-04-13 22:33:36] (651068724304019506) SM_Dark#5993: Oh god, my friend is starting to figure out all the problems I have because I haven't been careful enough these days. I don't want her to know anything, I don't want to burden her with all of my dumb problems when she has her own. I'm so scared that if she does figure it out, she'll tell her siblings or something. I don't think I can come up with good and believable excuses anymore. I just want to tell her everything but I'm just so scared.
[2021-04-13 22:38:45] (651068724304019506) SM_Dark#5993: I'm scared that she'll think all my problems are her fault and then I'll feel like a terrible human being for doing that to her.
[2021-04-13 23:28:03] (493049886585913346) EtzioGames#1725: just explain her, if shes ur friend shell be good about it

[2021-04-14 00:51:33] (825392044779503636) DinoGameDev#1621: Is it common to be depressed at one time of day, and wake up fine? And repeat the next night..?
[2021-04-14 00:51:52] (825392044779503636) DinoGameDev#1621: I’m depressed at night, but I’m fine all day..
[2021-04-14 00:53:32] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: That is normal for some people, yes. The daily cycle and the circadian rhythm are important aspects of biology.
[2021-04-14 01:03:45] (825392044779503636) DinoGameDev#1621: Alrighty, thanks for the response
[2021-04-14 01:23:49] (818286842554089472) E/Liz___( - )( - )( . Y . )#0572: ok so someone in the group put a selfie in the main chat and the same guys as before TOLD THEM THAT THEY WERE HIDEOUS AND THAT IT SHOULD BE IN CURSED IMAGES
[2021-04-14 01:26:36] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Sounds like a group of assholes. We would just stop associating with those kind of people completely.
[2021-04-14 01:44:37] (818286842554089472) E/Liz___( - )( - )( . Y . )#0572: I know but like I have made a lot of friends there 🥲
[2021-04-14 01:54:54] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: It's easy to make friends with assholes. No one wants to be friends with them. Better to have no friends than bad friends.
[2021-04-14 02:33:48] (763140046873821204) Alot O' Scott#6936: Had a friendly chat with my dad about my suicide attempts, self harm, substance abuse and ect. Cried a bit, might end up in the hospital and I'm just having a really shitty day altogether.
