[2021-04-14 16:08:55] (430621608877490186) Rodger#0283: Yes
[2021-04-14 16:09:11] (516313738588979210) Lil#1500: Can you give me an account of what happened in the vc?
[2021-04-14 16:11:30] (430621608877490186) Rodger#0283: So me, crow and Leo were ticking and I donâ€™t remember how but Elise somehow got onto the topic of ticks not being able to be complete sentences. He then got aggressive at us when we said we can get full sentence ticks
[2021-04-14 16:11:49] (430621608877490186) Rodger#0283: It was a back and forward
[2021-04-14 16:14:02] (430621608877490186) Rodger#0283: And it got more and more aggressive and he eventually said that you tick entire sentences you are faking ticks
