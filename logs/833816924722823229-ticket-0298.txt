[2021-04-19 21:31:12] (578626787547021312) 丂Ҝ乇ㄒ匚卄ㄚ#5025: I have quick question before I break any rules
[2021-04-19 21:31:21] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: go ahead!
[2021-04-19 21:32:05] (578626787547021312) 丂Ҝ乇ㄒ匚卄ㄚ#5025: I made a new server and I want to share it without breaking rules so can I ask if people wanna join without a link and if they say yes can I DM them a link?
[2021-04-19 21:33:13] (396441108995112970) beebee#3442: So we keep all other server stuff out of this server, if you ask them in dms, and send the link in dms thats fine, but you cant ask people if they want to join in the server if that makes sense
[2021-04-19 21:34:16] (578626787547021312) 丂Ҝ乇ㄒ匚卄ㄚ#5025: okay do I can ask through DM's (not sending a link without accepting) and I wont be warned for DM advertising?
