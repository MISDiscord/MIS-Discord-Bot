[2021-04-29 03:22:53] (673543138098413609) Something#4609: Fucking tanitis like the ear ringing
[2021-04-29 03:23:17] (673543138098413609) Something#4609: Its really fucking loud right now
[2021-04-29 03:23:30] (673543138098413609) Something#4609: Is there any way to quiet it?
[2021-04-29 03:23:51] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Oh dear friend, I'm really sorry to hear that you have pretty bad tinnitus.
[2021-04-29 03:24:28] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Some people often find that playing classical music at not too high a volume or also some white noise helps.
[2021-04-29 03:24:56] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: If you speak to your doctor they can hook you up with some audiologists who can help more directly.
[2021-04-29 03:25:18] (673543138098413609) Something#4609: It’s easy to aggravate it so i guess I really pissed it off
[2021-04-29 03:25:55] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: I really feel that friend, even just standing up too quickly can set it off.
[2021-04-29 03:28:12] (673543138098413609) Something#4609: The doctors even said that I don’t completely have it
[2021-04-29 03:29:51] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: If you think that they're wrong you can go back and say you'd like to be reassessed because the symptoms are really bothering you.
[2021-04-29 03:30:17] (673543138098413609) Something#4609: It’s just bad somedays
[2021-04-29 03:31:58] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: I really sympathise with that friend.
[2021-04-29 03:32:32] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Some days it's barely noticeable, others it can drown out a car engine easily.
[2021-04-29 03:33:17] (673543138098413609) Something#4609: Usually standard everyday things are enough to block it out
[2021-04-29 03:33:35] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Yeah.
[2021-04-29 03:34:11] (673543138098413609) Something#4609: It has been actually painful once
[2021-04-29 03:36:08] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Same here, if it's painful for more than a day you should definitely see a doctor.
[2021-04-29 03:38:07] (673543138098413609) Something#4609: Not for a day luckily
[2021-04-29 03:38:30] (673543138098413609) Something#4609: It was for like probably at most 1-2 minutes
[2021-04-29 03:39:13] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: It's great that it was only brief
[2021-04-29 03:39:45] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: If you don't mind me asking, did the tinnitus start after a specific event, such as being under pressure or a loud noise?
[2021-04-29 03:41:47] (673543138098413609) Something#4609: All through 9th grade I would listen to music on max only using my headphones
[2021-04-29 03:42:21] (673543138098413609) Something#4609: So every day for a average of 1 hour
[2021-04-29 03:43:38] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: That could possibly cause it
[2021-04-29 03:46:02] (673543138098413609) Something#4609: Yep
[2021-04-29 03:47:56] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Sometimes it can heal up and lessen a bit
[2021-04-29 03:48:27] (673543138098413609) Something#4609: It has been
[2021-04-29 03:49:34] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: That's good to hear
[2021-04-29 03:51:57] (673543138098413609) Something#4609: Even if I try its so quiet right now that my brain automatically blocks it out
[2021-04-29 03:52:09] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: That's really great my friend.
[2021-04-29 03:53:32] (356407905395933186) ddddeen#3925: Is there anything else you want help with my friend?
