[2021-04-09 18:42:40] (706050546775097344) Buddy#0008: I'm fed up for even trying anymore, I'm happy in the morning like always and then in the evening I'm getting stressed, annoyed and the only 3 friends I have, just don't give a shit about me, I hate it and I'm always putting on a fake smile and laugh but I'm just fed up and I can't be asked, I can't work anymore and put my head down, I'm most likey gonna fail in life and I just really can't be asked to continue this as to nothings going to happen which is good at all, I just wish I could revert things to how they were 2 months ago where I was happy, I had depression ever since primary school when I was like 10 and ever since then i've just been sad and unhappy in life, and I'm sick of hearing the "It'll get better" because It won't. It just won't.
