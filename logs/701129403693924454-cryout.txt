Something that might really mean a lot to her. Even though it might not help for the long run, it might make her realize how appreciated she is.

All in all though, I hope everything turns out okay, and if something bad were to happen (because I realize that nothing you would have done would have changed her mind at that point, so don't blame yourself), you can always message here for support. I'm really sorry that you're stuck between a rock and a hard place with this one, especially since you don't have much info on her.
