Something that might really mean a lot to her. Even though it might not help for the long run, it might make her realize how appreciated she is.

All in all though, I hope everything turns out okay, and if something bad were to happen (because I realize that nothing you would have done would have changed her mind at that point, so don't blame yourself), you can always message here for support. I'm really sorry that you're stuck between a rock and a hard place with this one, especially since you don't have much info on her.

[2021-04-18 03:20:19] (801176326039011359) weehehe#6437: I would ping support but I don’t want to wake anyone up right now, especially for this kind of conversation, I was going to file a private support ticket but I don’t know how many private supporters there actually are. That’s why I came to here, so I don’t have to ping anyone and I can still say something. 

Tw: ||suicide of a friend||
I feel emotionally ||empty inside|| (I’m not ||suicidal||, but I do need to talk about something related to that.) 
I now feel sort of guilty for having been happy the past 3 weeks, even though my happiness has been unrelated to what I’m trying to talk about: the ||death of an old irl friend||. 
It’s been just over two months since I heard that he ||ended his life||
We weren’t close for the past few years, but beforehand I really looked up to him. ||He was a good person, and I know I’ll never understand exactly why he did it, and that is so frustrating. And I missed his funeral for two reasons: 1, because I didn’t know his family so I didn’t know if I was invited and didn’t know how to call the parents for that conversation, and 2, because I had become happy after a few weeks, and I didn’t want to become sad again.|| I feel so guilty and selfish about the second reason, but I just wasn’t ready. 
I’m going to be okay, I know that. I’ll probably feel better tomorrow, but I’m scared that what happened will always be on my mind.
[2021-04-18 03:21:47] (184040294851936256) jupiter#5970: bestie you should file a ticket. we'll make sure someone can talk to you asap

[2021-04-18 04:30:31] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: Yes there is, everyone has a point of being alive. You might not do something that's ground-breaking in the time that you're alive but you've done something, big or small, that has affected someone's life.
[2021-04-18 04:33:06] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: I've been in your situation, and trust me, there are more people who care about you than you can imagine, everyone here loves you and cares about you and you mean a lot to us, and it would be devastating if you ||killed yourself||.

[2021-04-18 05:04:01] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: Everyone's a weirdo, and you don't need to change anything but your mindset. You are who you are and you're unique, let you be you and you'll have friends. You're an adult, and that means that your choices are heavier and those choices make you someone, no one thinks like you or feels like you. You are your own person and that means your worth something, not nothing. You are one of a kind.
[2021-04-18 05:04:26] (208542897543315456) pricklygoo#3760: I feel empathy but I feel so lost

[2021-04-18 05:05:57] (208542897543315456) pricklygoo#3760: The complete lack of external emotional development and nurturing from my parents is astounding
[2021-04-18 05:06:52] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: Hey, everyone goes through things and it can make you feel bad or shut off to society, but hey, I know that if you keep on with life you will find people you care about. You were raised different, and it can affect your life majorly, maybe try to seek someone with parental-like figure to help with that trauma.
[2021-04-18 05:07:45] (208542897543315456) pricklygoo#3760: Trauma at 12 caused panic and dissociation and completely changed the course of my development
[2021-04-18 05:08:39] (208542897543315456) pricklygoo#3760: I've had such a warped way of rationalising and internalising my emotions

[2021-04-18 05:15:05] (224176266318708736) parapara (team parzu)#0682: Do you ever journal? Sometimes writing emotions down can be helpful. I know I'm not bringing up anything unique, but just thought I would ask.
[2021-04-18 05:16:03] (208542897543315456) pricklygoo#3760: I enjoy competitive video games. Although I'm taking a break from that because it was becoming an addiction to run from myself

[2021-04-18 05:17:57] (208542897543315456) pricklygoo#3760: I'm just still dissociated all the time
[2021-04-18 05:18:18] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: Yeah, but is there a specific thing about it? the sound of your mouse or keyboard, the adrenaline, or anything of the sort?
[2021-04-18 05:18:32] (208542897543315456) pricklygoo#3760: I prefer controller gaming
[2021-04-18 05:18:35] (208542897543315456) pricklygoo#3760: The adrenaline
[2021-04-18 05:18:39] (208542897543315456) pricklygoo#3760: The focus that's required
[2021-04-18 05:18:59] (208542897543315456) pricklygoo#3760: Out thinking the opponent
[2021-04-18 05:19:15] (208542897543315456) pricklygoo#3760: It's like feeding some primitive prefatory instinct lol
[2021-04-18 05:19:23] (224176266318708736) parapara (team parzu)#0682: Hope I'm not invading or intruding in this conversation. But I think drawing is a great outlet. A great way to show emotion, too, even if it's subtle.
[2021-04-18 05:19:50] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: try to think about that when you feel bad, how you enjoy all of that. It's a good way to distract yourself.
[2021-04-18 05:20:03] (208542897543315456) pricklygoo#3760: Games were my drug of choice
[2021-04-18 05:20:12] (224176266318708736) parapara (team parzu)#0682: I find when we turn to the things we really love, our passions, it can make us happier. As long as we aren't addicted.
[2021-04-18 05:20:13] (208542897543315456) pricklygoo#3760: Think it beats alcohol and drugs
[2021-04-18 05:20:19] (224176266318708736) parapara (team parzu)#0682: But yeah it does.
[2021-04-18 05:20:27] (208542897543315456) pricklygoo#3760: But I don't actually have an unhealthy relationship with games anymore
[2021-04-18 05:20:32] (224176266318708736) parapara (team parzu)#0682: That's great!
[2021-04-18 05:20:38] (208542897543315456) pricklygoo#3760: Apex Legends really helped me the past few years
[2021-04-18 05:21:05] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: hey, can you take over? I have to do some things.
[2021-04-18 05:21:20] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: I hope I helped in the time I was talking to you
[2021-04-18 05:21:33] (224176266318708736) parapara (team parzu)#0682: Sure, I can be here for a little bit longer, if prickly is comfy talking more/with me.
[2021-04-18 05:21:49] (687826715321565200) TheJinxedDemon#4111: thanks buddy
[2021-04-18 05:22:26] (224176266318708736) parapara (team parzu)#0682: Games can be a good escape.
[2021-04-18 05:22:37] (224176266318708736) parapara (team parzu)#0682: And sometimes distraction is just necessary.
[2021-04-18 05:22:47] (224176266318708736) parapara (team parzu)#0682: Like, a form of meditation, if you will.
[2021-04-18 05:23:31] (208542897543315456) pricklygoo#3760: When you are raised with games as like a parent who's there for you when no one else is
[2021-04-18 05:23:37] (208542897543315456) pricklygoo#3760: Thats a really hard habit to change
[2021-04-18 05:24:08] (224176266318708736) parapara (team parzu)#0682: I mean, I can't disagree there at all. I was raised with TV pretty much and have a Netflix addiction. lol
[2021-04-18 05:24:25] (224176266318708736) parapara (team parzu)#0682: PLUS internet addiction for sure.
[2021-04-18 05:24:42] (224176266318708736) parapara (team parzu)#0682: But I think it's because I lack some things in my life right now.
[2021-04-18 05:24:51] (224176266318708736) parapara (team parzu)#0682: I get how that can happen.
[2021-04-18 05:25:28] (224176266318708736) parapara (team parzu)#0682: And you say you're disassociated all the time. Are you aware of grounding techniques?
[2021-04-18 05:26:11] (224176266318708736) parapara (team parzu)#0682: Or you can even find things that ground  you - whether it's a pet, singing... counting... or even laughing can be very grounding.
[2021-04-18 05:27:06] (224176266318708736) parapara (team parzu)#0682: My bf does translating to ground himself. So, even doing something you're passionate about can help.

[2021-04-19 12:16:29] (832398934063185940) Emmaz#6769: How about a therapist? they cant tell your parents and they might be able to work with the school or give you some ways to deal with this in a controlled way
[2021-04-19 12:17:38] (388564815641313280) sarawr#8913: I thought about it but my mum definitely won’t let me get one
[2021-04-19 12:18:19] (388564815641313280) sarawr#8913: The only person I told was one of my online bestfriends but she probably didn’t care she is nice but she didn’t get the idea how I feel

Still, you should take your time to focus on yourself and your feelings. If you're not feeling well because of the things people have told you, try to find positive points of yourself and your life

And it's okae to be upset. look for the positive in your life, the negative will hold you down.  ignore them if you have too, sorry

[2021-04-19 23:56:59] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Because they're really big, suffocating feelings, but we might be able to help, would you like to talk more?

[2021-04-20 00:06:19] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: Well, everything is temporary. Even happiness (I'm sure you can think of some time when you were really happy, or at least content, but that isn't now). So, maybe after talking a little more, the pain will go away even if it's just a little bit?
[2021-04-20 00:07:17] (499004656295608330) jayngles#0194: And it *will* go away, even if it takes a while

[2021-04-20 04:38:18] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: 5 colour countdown is a grounding technique where you look around your environment and name object of various colours. This technique deactivates the amygdala, the fear centre of the brain, and activates the pre-frontal cortex, the planning centre (in basic terms). To do this you name one colour and 5 items in your environment of that colour, then a second colour and 4 items, then a 3rd colour and 3 items, until you have named your last colour and last item.

It’s not my fault. I think I’m gonna ||leave her|| sometime soon because she doesn’t seem to care much. But I find it hard to do so because we’ve been on and off for 2 years so I don’t really have the strength to just do it once and for all.

[2021-04-21 01:23:59] (526500646925631510) FroggyMilk#8775: She said he was on drugs and stuck
[2021-04-21 01:24:03] (526500646925631510) FroggyMilk#8775: Drunk*
[2021-04-21 01:24:11] (526500646925631510) FroggyMilk#8775: So she would tell him off later
[2021-04-21 01:24:59] (526500646925631510) FroggyMilk#8775: But the guy texted me while I was in school since he got my number before that and was apologizing (not very good tho)

[2021-04-21 01:26:11] (820693593785237535) vampire#3465: mhmm okay. first of all being on drugs and being drunk is not an excuse for how he violated and disrespected you. I can tell he is not sorry at all. I suggest carrying a taser with you just to be safe.
[2021-04-21 01:26:50] (443130730478960670) Alora 🥩#7138: Whoa there. It is not legal to carry a taser in many places. You should be careful giving out such advice.

[2021-04-21 01:27:48] (526500646925631510) FroggyMilk#8775: He actually tugged on my leggings when I was driving him back to the house where my grandma was
[2021-04-21 01:28:19] (526500646925631510) FroggyMilk#8775: I pulled his hand so fast and I didn’t slow down my driving too
[2021-04-21 01:28:23] (526500646925631510) FroggyMilk#8775: It was dangerous
[2021-04-21 01:29:22] (820693593785237535) vampire#3465: if he ever does that again I recommend filing a police report

[2021-04-21 01:29:40] (526500646925631510) FroggyMilk#8775: She didn’t even mention it again

But like your thoughts are jumbled, and it’s hard to focus.... BUT THEN it’s realllllly easy to focus on stuff you enjoy, but that’s called hyper focusing and you can do that for hours and lose sleep. Ummm you also get emotional quickly and forget things, and a lot of the time you can forget what your doing. And it’s just hard to get important stuff done and keep track of important things like expenses and money.... which I may have dug a small hole into today lol it’s ok tho

[2021-04-22 04:54:50] (85147068900847616) B3Y0ND#7326: I have been really distant and closed off to everyone recently. ||Suicide thoughts|| have been coming and going for weeks now and I feel no emotion. She is really hurt by my distance but I can’t even show enough emotion to comfort her. I kind of just want to end it with her so I don’t hurt her more than I already have. I want what’s best for her and I’m not that. I’m just this ||depressed and suicidal|| shell of my former self. I just want to be normal. No one cares how I’m doing. No one asks me how I’m feeling or how my day was. No one cares enough to acknowledge my distance. All her friends just ||talk shit|| about me constantly and just say how bad of a boyfriend I am but I genuinely can’t do anything about it. I try to show affection but I can’t. I’m just nothing. I don’t feel like I have a purpose. A huge piece of myself is missing even though I have everything I need. I just have negative thoughts constantly and I can’t have positive thoughts. I want to be excited about things. I want to be able to be happy. I want to be like everyone else but I can’t. I finally broke down today and just cried for hours. No one acknowledges my mental health or emotions because I’m a man and I’m not supposed to be sad. I’m supposed to be this big tough firefighter who goes and helps other people and doesn’t need saving. But I need to be saved right now. I need someone to rescue me now and I know it sounds stupid but I genuinely need it. I’m scared of myself.

[2021-04-22 13:40:48] (312797486941077525) vEagle13#5630: i want to die right now and i highly doubt there's anything that can help me get rid of the suffering which causes this constant suicidal ideation. any attempt to answer why gives way to extreme confusion, reinforcing my belief that i'm truly helpless and doomed to kill myself brutally when i get the chance. no amount of words and ideas can cause feelings of realization or relief and i have no idea what needs to happen to me to fix this
[2021-04-22 14:03:37] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: I hope you feel better soon. Do you have a professional that's able to help you? They might be able to give you some good coping mechanism

[2021-04-22 14:06:41] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: You have to actively work on being happy every day
[2021-04-22 14:06:49] (312797486941077525) vEagle13#5630: if there's no other way, hten there is no way

[2021-04-22 14:07:58] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: You just have to try
[2021-04-22 14:08:12] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: First I would see if there's any local therapists you can go to

[2021-04-22 14:08:32] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: And then maybe look into ways of improving your mood

[2021-04-22 14:09:22] (312797486941077525) vEagle13#5630: this isn't something you brush off as an overreaction
[2021-04-22 14:09:47] (312797486941077525) vEagle13#5630: i've observed this to be true
[2021-04-22 14:10:25] (312797486941077525) vEagle13#5630: i may be biased but reactions and advice i got from my friends only continue to prove this
[2021-04-22 14:11:03] (312797486941077525) vEagle13#5630: i can't just go do something i don't want to do
[2021-04-22 14:11:53] (312797486941077525) vEagle13#5630: but i also have observed that feelings of desire are so minimal, they never motivate me either
[2021-04-22 14:12:25] (312797486941077525) vEagle13#5630: the strongest emotion i have is fear, and even that is not enough
[2021-04-22 14:27:13] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: I apologize I didn't take it as an overreaction at all. I'm aware how Important mental health is.may I ask what your goal is? Are you trying to find ways to feel better or do you just need to go through your emotions at this moment?
[2021-04-22 14:28:35] (312797486941077525) vEagle13#5630: i don't know why i'm doing this
[2021-04-22 14:28:52] (312797486941077525) vEagle13#5630: "find ways to feel better" sounds so great
[2021-04-22 14:28:57] (312797486941077525) vEagle13#5630: and so impossible
[2021-04-22 14:29:28] (475476960164839426) Mercury#1225: Well I could definitely give you some ideas on how to do that if you want
[2021-04-22 14:30:36] (312797486941077525) vEagle13#5630: if they require me doing something that takes effort, i'm not sure i'll do it

[2021-04-22 14:35:16] (312797486941077525) vEagle13#5630: i never feel the need to be told obvious things
[2021-04-22 14:36:24] (312797486941077525) vEagle13#5630: chances are, what i lack is proof that there's nothing stopping me from ending it all right this moment
[2021-04-22 14:38:50] (312797486941077525) vEagle13#5630: i suspect what i really want to accomplish is to assert to strangers that i'm in danger
[2021-04-22 14:39:00] (312797486941077525) vEagle13#5630: but i have no idea why
